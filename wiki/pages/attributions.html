{% block lead %}This page must show the attribution form of your project. This includes the work done by each of the student members on your team and any work that was done by people outside of your team, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster. This requirement is not about literature references - these can and should be displayed throughout your wiki.{% endblock %}

        In the iGEM Competition, we celebrate student effort and achievement. The Attributions form helps the judges
        differentiate between what students accomplished from how their external collaborators supported them.
        Therefore, teams must clearly explain on the standard Project Attributions form what work they have
        conducted by themselves and what has been done by others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Teams must use the standard Attributions form. To meet the attributions requirement, you must display the
        standard form on your Wiki by following the instructions here:
        <a href="https://competition.igem.org/deliverables/project-attribution">Project Attribution page</a>.
      </p>

    <div class="bd-callout bd-callout-info">
      <h4>Bronze Medal Criterion #2</h4>
      <p>Describe what work your team members did and what other people did for your project.</p>
      <p>The form that has been embedded in an iframe in this page shows your team's Project Attribution form. This page must keep the form as it is.</p>
      <p>If you use a different website framework, make sure to embed the right URL for your team's form.</p>
