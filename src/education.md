As mentioned in [Mencius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mencius), the wise enlighten others through their own clarity; today, those who are confused can also enlighten others. This underscores the importance of *self-education* before *educating others*. We realize that understanding knowledge from the perspective of learners is essential for effective education. Thus, while conducting our  educational activities this year, we focuse on exploring the needs of our target audience and developing the educational skills of our members.

Our goal is to inspire students across all educational stages in China, planting the seeds of [synthetic biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_biology) within schools, so they can consider this field in their future career paths and interests.

## Education for University Students

<p><small style="color: gray">📅 Date: Nov.11, 2023<br>🗣️ Organizers: Ziming Suo, Kexin Zheng, Xujie Tan, Ruiwen Ma, Hongcheng Chen<br>👥 Audience: Public in Fudan University</small></p>

Our team secured two booths at the [Starry Sky Academic Culture Festival](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/d18fl0Bhf2tGK7M7HiVJYw) at Fudan University to showcase synthetic biology and our project. During this event, we enthusiastically introduced synthetic biology concepts and information about iGEM to undergraduate and graduate students. We also gained insights into effective educational approaches and the appropriate complexity of popular science for higher education students, laying a solid foundation for future educational initiatives. [This experience](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/ZAvP470rsg1TDX8qlwq5sw) also helped our team members refine their presentation skills and abilities.

However, during the activities, we realized that our team members' proficiency in synthetic biology knowledge was not sufficient to effectively carry out our educational initiatives. Therefore, we decided to participate in Education Forum and conduct internal training to learn and enhance education skills.

### Details about the Education Forum

Some members of the team participated in the Expedition Education Forum, an exchange event aimed at providing better educational services to disadvantaged groups in society. Our team representative spoke, shared our goals and vision—to provide accessible synthetic biology knowledge to people across all educational stages. We also objectively highlighted the challenges we face in engaging students and the complexity of the material, which garnered enthusiastic support and guidance from the attending professional education teams. 具体什么反馈 有没有列表形式的

During discussions in the 4th sub-forum, we learned an important educational principle — *supply and demand balance*. Following this principle, the knowledge we provided should meet the needs of students/audiences. Additionally, *learner-centered education* is crucial. We need more understanding and adaptation when addressing diverse and unique learners. Each roundtable discussion sparked educational ideas, and our team members not only gained teaching skills but also embraced the responsibility that comes with education.

To building a collaborative world, international exchange and understanding among global youth are important.

After we graduated from the Education Forum, we carried out our second round education practice with international students on our campus, aiming to enhance the universality and readability of educational tools. Exchange students from countries and regions including Indonesia, Germany, Slovakia, Morocco, Norway, Macau, Singapore, and Nipple participated in this event, greatly contributing to our understanding of education. This experience laid the groundwork for adapting our upcoming illustrated educational tools into multiple languages.

After this event, we were pleased to see a significant improvement in our team members' understanding of education, as well as a further enhancement of their communication skills. With this progress, we moved forward to promote synthetic biology knowledge to high school students in China.

## Education for High School Students

<p><small style="color: gray">📅 Date: Mar.3, 2024<br>🗣️ Organizers: Yuhan Li, Kexin Zheng, Xujie Tan, Wanqi Li, Hongcheng Chen<br> 👥 Audience: High school students from all over China</small></p>

By collaborating with the State Key Laboratory of Genetics Engineering, we [invited high school students](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/PkEyOO0QkiYaLgErkqDIbw) from across China to participate in a summer camp at Fudan University focused on understanding biological sciences. During the camp, we guided the students on a tour of the campus and biology labs, culminating in a roundtable discussion where we aimed to learn about their perceptions of synthetic biology and provide educational outreach.

In the discussion, we found that high school students' understanding of synthetic biology could cover the basics, especially if they had taken high school biology courses. They expressed more interest in the research aspects of synthetic biology. They eager to participate some kind daily lab work, which could help them clarify their aspirations when choosing majors in college. This points to a future collaboration between synthetic biology education and high school students' career planning.

Building on [the roundtable discussion](#details-about-the-educaiton-forum), we gained a clearer understanding of how to conduct education aimed at high school students. To stimulate their interest, we collaborated with the Science Popularization Education Base 需要加链接 at Tongji University to plan a career experience event for high school students from Anting Middle School 需要加链接. The activities included a GMO lecture, a tour of genetically modified rice fields, and a sharing session on synthetic biology, planting the seeds of synthetic biology in their minds.
