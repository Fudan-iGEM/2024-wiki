We actively participated in the ["Decoding Life"](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/STqVKyVcpHO6wS6KVQVsnA): excellent high school student summer camp organized by the [School of Life Sciences at Fudan University](https://life.fudan.edu.cn/). During this event, we engaged in insightful discussions with high school students hailing from the Yangtze River Delta region. Topics ranged from scientific research and university education models to our own experiences in iGEM.
:::



Interacting with these students highlighted **a significant gap** in Chinese education system. Chinese high school students are under intense academic pressure, with little time for career planning. Therefore, we hope to establish **an efficient resource platform** in the future, to help students learn about biology majors including synthetic biology.

**Facilitating the establishment of high school iGEM teams** is one of the most significant contents of our educational work to promote synthetic biology among high school students.

[THIS DL](http://www.thisdl.cn/en/) (Tsinghua International School, Daoxiang Lake) is a renowned international high school in Beijing, where an increasing number of students have shown interest in synthetic biology in recent years. Consequently, collaborating with [LabXcel](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/V0qpYWEFsmSve0NhsBv2hw), an educational company dedicated to inspiring and nurturing scientific thinking in young minds, we conducted a lecture at THIS DL titled ***Exploring Microbial Design, Integrating Multidisciplinary Talents*** to further cultivate their enthusiasm and encourage their participation in [iGEM 2024](https://competition.igem.org/).



::: details
During the lecture, we emphasized the **interdisciplinary** nature of iGEM, encouraging students from diverse backgrounds, including biology, programming, business, and graphic design, to participate. We also shared success stories of high school iGEM teams to illustrate the multifaceted skills assessment involved (see more details [here](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4765/wiki/education/collaboration-with-enterprise-preparing-for-this-dl-team.pdf)).

The lecture session was followed by an engaging **Q&A** session, during which we discussed various topics and project ideas with the students. Notably, one student presented a project concept titled "Soil Cadmium Ion Content Determination Technology via Plant Gene Editing," and we provided valuable suggestions on its modeling and execution. We also answered numerous questions from students interested in graphic design, human practices, and other areas of synthetic biology.

The **Conference of China iGEMer Community (CCiC)**, an annual gathering initiated by Chinese iGEM teams. We were intended to achieve resource sharing and collaborative learning through this pivotal platform.

- **Presentation:** During CCiC, we showcased our project, which focused on ecological biofilm design for terraforming (follow [this link for detailed description](/description/)).

- **Collaboration:** Interacting with fellow iGEM teams from all over the country, we engaged in collaborative discussions and knowledge exchange, fostering mutual growth and learning.



#### Sustaining Collaboration

Participating in CCiC allowed us to witness the remarkable growth of synthetic biology in China. Committed to fortifying inter-regional bonds, we took the initiative to establish **the iGEM Alliance of the Yangtze River Delta**. This alliance, comprising esteemed institutions such as [ShanghaiTech](https://2024.igem.wiki/shanghaitech-china/), [TJU](https://2024.igem.wiki/tongji-software/), [ZJU](https://2024.igem.wiki/zju-china/), [NJU](https://2024.igem.wiki/nanjing-china/), and [SJTU](https://2024.igem.wiki/sjtu-biox-shanghai/), represents a unified regional community dedicated to advancing synthetic biology.  Additionally, we have sought support from **the Shanghai Society of Genetics**. To date, these schools in the alliance have collaboratively crafted a series of educational children's picture books. With our collective endeavors, we hold a confident vision that the alliance will etch a profound and enduring mark on the future landscape of synthetic biology in China and beyond.





## Summary

Our educational initiatives, collectively represented by "**FIRE**", encompass a diverse range of endeavors. From stimulating and satisfying the curiosity of children and teenagers in synthetic biology to providing interactive biological explorations in partnership with famous museums, from bringing synthetic biology to the public through games and street interviews and conversations to empowering the iGEM community within Fudan University, educational enterprises, the Yangtze River Delta region and even China, these efforts aim to kindle a blazing passion for synthetic biology. Just as the fire of Heaven from [Prometheus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheus) igniting the spirit of humanity, we aspire to **demystify synthetic biology** and ignite a wildfire of **enthusiasm for synthetic biology** in the hearts of all individuals through our **tailored, engaging, and informative** educational initiatives.
