I’m a bit torn about whether to refer to them as a "group," "population," "patients," "angels," or "Star Children." Could "patients" be considered discriminatory? (We can clarify our unified terminology at the beginning moving forward.)

## 1 We shall eliminate barriers between ASD and science

(Maybe consider changing it to a photo of people holding hands in a circle.)

Globally, about 1 in every 100 children is diagnosed with **Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)**. They seem distant, which is why they are often given two beautiful names: **Star Children** and **Angels**. ASD is the most common and representative disorder within the category of pervasive developmental disorders. It typically begins in early childhood and is characterized by social interaction difficulties, communication challenges, restricted interests, and repetitive behaviors. Many children with ASD also experience varying degrees of intellectual disability.

**However, does ASD inherently create an insurmountable barrier to science?** We want to say, **the answer is no!** In recent years, the concept of **neurodiversity** has gained increasing recognition. Its core idea is that so-called "disorders" are actually normal variations in human cognition, emotion, learning, and neurological function. Neurodevelopmental disorders, especially autism, are better understood as part of a spectrum, encompassing a range of measurable traits found throughout the general population. In fact, our research has shown that individuals with ASD may display unique talents in **STEM** (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields, and many might even pursue careers in STEM. *[Examples like Zhou Wei or notable scientists can be mentioned here.]*

Unfortunately, **real barriers still exist**. Through literature reviews, surveys, interviews, and field observations, we have conducted in-depth research into the obstacles that ASD individuals face in engaging with science. Here are the key findings. **[Attach a detailed report of our findings as a reference.]**

1. Due to a lack of specialized professionals, current STEM education for ASD individuals is scarce, with most lessons focusing only on mathematics. (This could be supplemented with a white paper.) (Our interdisciplinary team aims to address this and attract collaborative partners.)
2. The content is often abstract and requires high cognitive ability from students. (We propose STEAMed to address this issue.) (Start with A, then move to Med.)
3. Public awareness is low, and the importance of scientific outreach for the ASD community is often overlooked. (We focus on promoting awareness.)
4. The increasing prevalence of ASD has led to a growing demand for educational resources. (We aim to scale after initial pilots.)

Our interviewees, including parents of ASD individuals, experts in special education and public welfare, as well as staff from rehabilitation centers and special schools, have all expressed a shared desire to **remove these barriers**. Teachers from various rehabilitation centers and special schools **welcomed** the idea of us piloting **more practical, concrete, and interactive** lessons after refining our course designs. Now we are here, inspired to eliminate the barriers and expand their access to science.

## 2 Ideal: from STEM to STEAMed

Based on the needs and characteristics of individuals with ASD, and leveraging our team's expertise and interdisciplinary strengths, we propose an innovative educational approach called **STEAMed** (science, technology, engineering, art, mathematics, and medicine). We have named our project “STEAMed Education — for Scientists from the Star.”

**[Image: newly designed logo]**

### 2.1 Why do we propose STEAMed?

**STEAM** (science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics) is an emerging interdisciplinary educational model that allows students to approach science through the appreciation and creation of art, greatly **enhancing the accessibility and inclusivity** of traditional STEM courses. This helps break down barriers between students and scientific knowledge. Both STEM education and art therapy have been shown to benefit individuals with ASD. However, **there has been no research specifically focusing on STEAM education for the ASD community**. Building upon STEAM, we propose an even more innovative and targeted educational approach called **STEAMed**. Medicine, being closely linked to everyday life, plays a key role in helping individuals with ASD **understand their condition**, **accept themselves**, and develop healthy daily habits. We hope to use everyday topics to help individuals with ASD engage with STEM, making science a form of companionship.

**[Attachment: existing research and identified gaps]** (Refer to our project proposal document.)

### 2.2 Did stakeholders support STEAMed?

Through exhibitions, interviews, teaching observations, and *surveys (still ongoing)*, we further validated the value, innovation, and feasibility of our overall concept from various perspectives. In this process, **our ideas and concepts have received high praise**, reinforcing our belief in the immense potential of "STEAMed."

We invited two associate professors from Fudan University’s **School of Social Development and Public Policy** for in-person discussions. Both are dedicated to public welfare projects. **[Associate Professor Fu Fang]** has overseen several projects focusing on children with autism, while Associate Professor **Yu Zhiyuan** specializes in charitable work and social organizations. They highly praised the initial concept of STEAMed: **“Your team is dynamic, interdisciplinary, creative, and action-oriented. We believe you will inject fresh energy into the field of autism public welfare!”** (This quote is fabricated; perhaps we could rephrase it.)

*(This image doesn't seem to load for some reason.)* *(We plan to replace it with the profile pictures of the two teachers.)*

*(What would be the best way to present this paragraph?)* We served as volunteer guides and visited the **“Colorful Starry Sky” Human Body and Art Themed Art Exhibition**, co-hosted by the Fudan University Human Body Science Museum and the Angel's Companion Salon. The artwork was created by the Star Children after their visit to the human body science exhibit. The **bold use of color, innovative composition, and unique perspectives** in the pieces had a tremendous impact on us, allowing us to vividly perceive the potential and talent of the Star Children in **medical science awareness and artistic creation**. After the exhibition, we separately visited the director of the Human Body Science Museum and the educational head of the Angel's Companion Salon. Encouragingly, they expressed strong support for the “STEAMed” concept and look forward to further collaboration in the future.

We also communicated with rehabilitation institutions and special education schools. The **Beijing Rainbow Village International Health and Wellness Base** has primarily focused on ASD children aged 2 to 7, but has recently begun to expand its efforts to older and elderly individuals. In an interview, its senior business director, **Wang Yishuang**, mentioned that “people with physical disabilities often receive more sympathy and assistance, while **those with intellectual disabilities are more likely to be excluded**.” Our efforts may help **“open a window”** for them to realize their scientific potential.

【MP3】【Transcript】

We contacted **several autism-related educational institutions in Shanghai** and **interned there as volunteers**. Before and after the internship, we further explored the needs and characteristics of the institutions and their students through both online and offline interviews. These institutions expressed that, due to limitations in faculty and other resources, they are **unable to effectively implement popular science courses** (this may overlap with the barriers mentioned in the first section) and are very much looking forward to establishing long-term cooperation with us. The internship also deepened our understanding of the arts, such as how the Angel's Companion Salon focuses on enlightening the minds of the children through **musical immersion**. Additionally, we discovered that various institutions provide rich **physical activities** for the ASD community, which inspired us to design course themes that incorporate relevant physical activity elements.

## 3 Teaching Methods

### 3.1 Pilot and Tiered Teaching Method

After establishing the preliminary concept of STEAMed, we encountered two challenges: **popularity and specificity**. During discussions, the two associate professors suggested that we select **representative groups** to conduct small-scale pilot programs, making a **"breakthrough from zero to one."** Our initial internship experiences also indicated that **the familiarity between educators and students** is crucial, which can only be achieved through relatively long-term service at a specific location. During the pilot phase, we can gain deeper insights into the **specific needs of different subgroups** (details will be addressed in section 3.7) and develop a preliminary validated, replicable course model that lays a solid foundation for broader service promotion. As the saying goes, **"A single spark can start a prairie fire."**

Therefore, we began selecting suitable pilot subjects. Compared to rehabilitation institutions, special schools have higher requirements for the regularity and systematicity of courses, making them unsuitable as early pilot subjects. After thorough communication with various rehabilitation institutions, we ultimately chose **Zhan Lan and Rainbow Rain**. The teachers from both institutions expressed a supportive attitude, stating, **“Why not give it a try!”** Zhan Lan is **Shanghai's first NGO** to offer physical, intellectual, and vocational development training programs for **older** individuals with intellectual disabilities. The **Zhan Lan Angels** have relatively strong comprehension, social, and expression skills, showing a keen interest in science. Additionally, the Zhan Lan Angels are often in vocational stages, such as baristas and chefs, making STEAMed more closely related to their daily lives. In contrast, Rainbow Rain provides physical and cognitive rehabilitation training for **ASD children**, representing another subgroup of the ASD population.

### 3.2 Process Evaluation System

(The outcome evaluation system will be addressed in Section 4.) (Should we focus more on different dimensions in the evaluation for different tiered subjects?)

One major challenge is how to evaluate the course effectiveness during the process. A robust evaluation mechanism will enhance the effectiveness and scientific basis of our teaching. The core characteristics of the ASD population are social interaction and communication difficulties, meaning that feedback obtained from them may be limited. Therefore, we pay special attention to the perspectives of stakeholders. With the suggestions and guidance from teachers at various nonprofit institutions, our evaluation primarily focuses on the following four aspects:

1. How was the student's experience in this class?
2. How interested were the students in this lesson?
3. Did the students deepen their understanding of a particular issue?
4. Did this class help the students in their daily lives?
5. What aspects of this lesson can be improved?

Methodologically, we use post-class tests for **objective** evaluations and conduct self-assessments and interviews with stakeholders (experts, special education professionals, parents, nonprofit workers, volunteers, etc.) for **subjective** evaluations.

【Refer to Xiang Bo's project proposal for further improvement, which includes a flowchart drawn by Zi Ming.】

### 3.3 The Guidelines for Education (Also included in section 8.4; should this be written here?)

During the research process, we received many valuable details and supplementary suggestions. We organized these into two initial teaching guidelines: one for course content design and another for interactive considerations. We will continue to refine these guidelines as we implement the subsequent courses.

*【Attached: PDF of questionnaire titles + PDF of questionnaire results】 (still ongoing)*

## 4 STEAMed Practice

After thorough validation and discussion, we carefully launched the STEAMed course. In each class, we guide ASD students (hereinafter referred to as "students") to explore a "small scientific question" rooted in daily life, enhancing their skills in "Science," "Technology," "Engineering," "Art," and "Medicine."

**Our teaching materials include three types:**

1. Picture books or colorful teaching materials, created by us or adapted after obtaining copyrights. These will be used for theoretical learning, drawing sessions, and small tests.
2. Teaching aids, primarily handmade tools, including origami and paper-cutting. These will be used in hands-on activities to develop "Engineering" skills.
3. Game tools, primarily cards. These will be used as props for physical games.

**Our process evaluations include three types:**

1. Objective evaluations through testing, distributed to students to complete after class.
2. Subjective evaluations, distributed to students to score the course after class.
3. Subjective evaluations through interviews with volunteers, special education teachers, and parents involved throughout the process, to assess the changes in students.

We also explored "STEAMed" teaching for high-functioning and low-functioning students, hoping that "STEAMed" can be more universally applicable and help more students.

#### 4.1.1 Topic Selection

Last year, we achieved great results in the "Gene" series picture book teaching, which inspired us to choose "Gene Science" as the theme for our first course. This initial course serves as a pilot to explore whether the STEAMed model can work effectively. Therefore, during the course design phase, we not only conceptualized the content of this course but also contemplated the questions we wanted to answer in this first attempt.

**Course Content:**

1. What are genes and what is their internal structure?
2. What are the rules of complementary base pairing?
3. How do genes influence traits?
4. Why is each of us unique?

**Questions:**

1. How well can ASD children comprehend and cooperate?
2. How should the teaching staff be arranged?

#### 4.1.2 Preparation

Before the first course began, we had online discussions and exchanges with the teachers from Zhan Lan Public Welfare. During the discussions, we explained our course design approach and received feedback from the front-line teachers:

<div style="text-align: center;" id="fig1">
    <img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5115/inclusivity/online-meeting-with-zhanlan.jpg" style="width:100%">

          <span style="color: gray">Figure 4.1.2 Online Meeting with Zhanlan</span>
      <br><br>
    </div>
</div>


1. Based on experience, ASD children can accept popular science teaching on gene science, but it's important to pay attention to repetition and the pace of the lesson.
2. It is recommended that we adopt a "1-to-2" or "1-to-1" configuration of "instructor/volunteer - service recipient."
3. It is suggested that we design hands-on drawing, crafts, or physical activity segments.

After communicating with Zhan Lan Public Welfare, we confirmed the design logic and course materials for this lesson after extensive discussions with the supervising teachers. We also adopted a "1-to-2" teaching method and recruited volunteers from Fudan University to participate in our activities throughout.

#### 4.1.3 Course Implementation

**1. Scientific Knowledge:** In this course, we used a picture book teaching model. Based on our colorful picture books from last year, we made thorough simplifications and necessary additions to the content for the ASD population. The picture book: [Picture Book A](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5115/inclusivity/picture-book-a-course-1.pdf)

<div style="text-align: center;" id="fig1">

          <span style="color: gray">Figure 4.1.3.1 Course 1 Zhanlan 1</span>
      <br><br>
    </div>
</div>


**2. Artistic Ability:** In the picture book, we designed a drawing activity that uses the differences in "pea colors" to illustrate the relationship between traits and genes. At the same time, we guided ASD children to create "self-portraits" (ART), enhancing their sense of self-identity and allowing them to be "uniquely themselves."

      <br><br>
    </div>
</div>


**3. Engineering Understanding and Practical Ability:** We also designed a "Base Pairing" game to develop their physical coordination while deepening their understanding of scientific concepts during the activity.

#### 4.1.4 Course Evaluation

We designed a post-course self-assessment questionnaire, which can be found in the attachment: [course-1-quiz](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5115/inclusivity/course-1-quiz.pdf)

In their responses to these questionnaires, the students demonstrated a solid understanding of the genetics topics covered.

[Analysis Chart]

#### 4.1.5 Reflection

We had a discussion with Professor Fang Fu from Fudan University, and she concluded that the outcomes of this session were excellent. She believes that STEAMed can continue to move forward.

<div style="text-align: center;" id="fig1">
    <img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5115/inclusivity/course-1-interview-volunteer.png" style="width:100%">

          <span style="color: gray">Figure 4.1.5 Interview Volunteers</span>
      <br><br>
    </div>
</div>


At the same time, the teachers and volunteers provided valuable suggestions:

1. Increase hands-on activities to help students complete their scientific exploration of "genes" under guidance.
2. Familiarize ourselves with each student's personality in advance; implementing "STEAMed" requires a personalized approach.
3. The one-on-one and one-on-two models, along with reflections, are indeed effective.

After detailed discussions, we accepted these suggestions. This course has boosted our confidence and assured us that the "STEAMed" model is feasible.

</div>


#### 4.3.1 Theme Selection

Inspired by our first course, we also fully adapted our previous picture book to design a curriculum centered on genetic engineering. Building on our first experience, the implementation of this course was much smoother.

**Course Content:**

1. What is the structure of the DNA double helix?
2. What are the steps involved in genetic engineering?
3. How is "Golden Rice" made?

#### 4.3.2 Course Implementation

**1. Scientific Knowledge:** In this course, we again used the picture book teaching model, further simplifying and supplementing the necessary content based on our colorful picture book from last year for the ASD population. Please see the attachment: [Picture-Book-B](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5115/inclusivity/picture-book-b-course-2.pdf).

**2. Engineering Skills:** Using the DNA double helix structure as a backdrop, we guided the students in creating a DNA spiral structure through origami. This hands-on activity helped them understand the scientific knowledge of DNA.

#### 4.4.1 Topic Selection

The artwork of the star children has also inspired us to explore their interest in human science and brain science. Understanding brain science is a process of self-awareness and recognizing differences.

**Course Content:**

1. What is the structure of the brain?
2. What is a neuron?
3. How do we perceive vision?

#### 4.4.2 Course Implementation

**1. Scientific Knowledge:** We used a teaching-guidance method to educate the students about the structure of the brain and the generation of sensory perception.

#### 4.5.1 Topic Selection

The teachers at Rainbow Village mentioned that the students have a fondness for candy (possibly related to their cognitive performance). We also learned that the students generally have a need for developing life skills, and their parents hope we can incorporate more science courses related to personal habits into our curriculum. Therefore, we chose the topic of "Dental Health."

**Course Content:**

1. What is the process of tooth growth?
2. The Bass brushing technique.
3. How to make toothpaste from scratch.

#### 4.5.2 Course Implementation

**1. Scientific Knowledge:** We used a teaching-guided approach to educate the students about the classification and growth of teeth.

During the course, we discovered that in the age of artificial intelligence, students can obtain information of interest through the internet, even using smart assistants (like Xiao Ai, although this is not a typical AI assistant). We also found that students could relax when alone. Some students, like typical children, enjoy playing games. Therefore, we chose information technology and artificial intelligence as the topic, utilizing game-based websites to cultivate the students' "STEAMed" abilities.

**Course Content:**

1. What is artificial intelligence?
2. What can information technology bring us?
3. Online mini-games related to synthetic biology education.

#### 4.6.2 Course Implementation

**1. Technological Perspective:** We provided students with a science popularization lesson on the development of information technology. Our slides can be found in the attachment: [course-5-ppt.pdf](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5115/inclusivity/course-5-ppt.pdf)

#### 4.6.3 Feedback

We designed a post-class self-evaluation questionnaire, which can be found in the attachment: [course-5-quiz](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5115/inclusivity/course-5-quiz.pdf).

The students demonstrated a thorough understanding of artificial intelligence in their responses to these questionnaires.

In our conversation with Professor Fu Fang, we noted the impact of different levels of functionality in autism on teaching. In response to the diverse needs of the ASD population, we decided to adopt a **differentiated teaching** approach.

<div style="text-align: center;" id="fig1">

          <span style="color: gray">Figure 4.7.1 Discuss with Mrs. Cui</span>
      <br><br>
    </div>
</div>


We had both in-person and online discussions with Wang Yishuang, the Senior Business Director at Beijing Rainbow Village International Health Base, and Cui Jingjing from Shanghai Rainbow Rain. Based on the experts' suggestions, we recognized that there are differences in IQ, learning abilities, and language expression among various groups. Therefore, for those who are relatively disadvantaged, it is necessary to further simplify the course content, reduce the difficulty level, and focus on reinforcement and repetition during teaching. Additionally, patients of different age groups have distinct needs. For younger patients, companionship is crucial, accompanied by appropriate enlightenment. For older patients, greater emphasis should be placed on connecting with vocational skills to help them better adapt to society. Thus, we need to **more specifically tailor the teaching content and difficulty** based on the patients' opinions, needs, and values.

After careful consideration, we agreed with the experts' views and conducted two sessions of STEAMed teaching for low-functioning autistic students at Shanghai Rainbow Rain. The content and approach of the teaching were derived from [4.1 Course I Gene Science](/fudan/inclusivity/#4-1-course-Ⅰ-gene-science).

In our first practice, the feedback was not ideal, as the students did not understand the concept of genes. After reflecting on this, we conducted a second practice. We used the same course but further reduced the difficulty and added more hands-on activities, resulting in a much more successful outcome.

These efforts demonstrated the potential for differentiated teaching within the STEAMed framework. We hope to have the opportunity to further promote differentiated STEAMed teaching and help eliminate barriers for ASD students in the field of science.



## 5 Results (to be improved)

After completing several rounds of teaching, we conducted interviews with experts, teachers, and parents [Attachment: transcript] to obtain a more comprehensive and objective evaluation and to identify areas for improvement.

### 5.1 Highlights (how to avoid repetition with Section 8)

- Developed replicable educational content
- Targeted evaluation system
- Positive impact on a portion of the ASD population.

"He's holding onto it."

### 5.2 Shortcomings and areas for improvement

Due to time constraints, there was still insufficient attention to relatively lower-level concerns. Professor Fu Fang [Attachment: transcript] suggested that in the future, we could facilitate interaction between different ASD subgroups.

We will continue to design new teaching content based on the needs and interests of the learners. Additionally, we look forward to incorporating more physical and artistic forms of expression.

## 6 Publicity and Promotion

### 6.1 Public education

As mentioned above, public awareness is one of the barriers for the ASD population in accessing science. Therefore, we are particularly eager to spark interest in raising awareness of the scientific potential of the ASD community.

#### 6.1.1 Media promotion

In addition to the posts and vlogs released during the course, we have written a popular science post [draft completed, awaiting release] to raise awareness of the ASD community.

We also submitted an article to China's mainstream media outlet [“The Paper”](https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_28867253), providing a comprehensive summary and review of STEAMed education. The article has been published on The Paper's app and website, and will be promoted through various mainstream media platforms, with the editor estimating a **million-level readership** for the single article.

#### 6.1.2 Charity sales

April 2, 2024, marks the 17th **“World Autism Awareness Day”**. Taking this opportunity, we held three **charity sales** events on various campuses of Fudan University. In addition to the usual cultural and creative products and artworks from the ASD community, we designed a set of postcards based on our picture book [PDF attached]. We shared this year's inclusivity project with people inside and outside the university, using the postcards to collect public messages in hopes of inspiring scientific interest in the ASD community. After the charity sale, we donated the proceeds along with the postcards to [Rainbow Rain].

#### 6.1.3 Teaching Collaboration

We recruited volunteers for STEAMed education targeting the ASD community through [online posts](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/R--7Ph2Z23VN8PBek537Og) and offline booths. Additionally, we provided a volunteer registration channel for the general public through WeChat groups. Through hands-on practice, volunteers were able to gain a deeper understanding of the significance of popular science education for the ASD community.

### 6.2 Engaging with the Public Welfare Sector (consider moving to 8.2)

We were invited to participate in the **[Expedition Forum](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/rz5_monngU4MajMzbODBXg)** and the **Fudan Public Welfare Exchange Gathering**. At the Expedition Forum, there were four guests from large public welfare institutions and foundations, as well as public welfare organizations from 18 universities across six provinces. The Fudan Public Welfare Exchange Gathering included six guest professors, 18 alumni guests, and seven student organization leaders. During the open discussion, members of public welfare organizations expressed their willingness to collaborate with us, and the guests indicated that they would help connect us with more public welfare resources in the future to jointly promote this meaningful project.

## 7 our sustainable mechanism

### 7.1 Teaching Targets

In the future, we will focus on a broader range of ASD populations and individuals with intellectual disabilities. Beyond rehabilitation institutions, we have also reached out to several **special education schools** for ASD in Shanghai. They are all eager to apply our refined curriculum to help break down the barriers between their students and science. Throughout the project, we have also engaged with **other groups with intellectual disabilities**, who face similar challenges as the ASD community. We aim to inspire scientific interest in more of these related groups and tap into their scientific potential. This is also the true essence of neurodiversity and inclusivity.

### 7.2 Partners

As mentioned in Section 7, we have received support from individual volunteers, public welfare organizations, and public welfare institutions. In addition to the [Bertalanffy Club], operated by iGEM, we have also reached long-term cooperation agreements with the [Fudan University Nanshangu Association] and the [Fudan University Red Cross]. Together, we will design and deliver courses. With the support of these partners, we are confident in the long-term sustainability of our project. (This final sentence can be deleted.)

### 7.3 Funding Sources

After submitting applications and going through a selection process, we successfully received funding from Fudan University's Undergraduate Academic Practice Research Support Program, known as the Xiangbo Project. We also secured funding intentions from the **U.S. Consulate General in Shanghai**. Additionally, [Professor Fu Fang] and [Professor Yu Zhiyuan] have expressed their willingness to help us obtain sponsorships from foundations and hospitals.

This section requires input from Ziming and Kexin to supplement ideas for the commercial page.

### 7.4 A Foundation for Others

Our STEAMed is an innovative and replicable concept. All of our course materials (including lesson plans, PPTs, post-lesson assessments, etc.) have been distributed freely both offline and online nationwide. We have summarized our experience with science education for the ASD population into two guides, which have been uploaded in multiple languages. We welcome other organizations to contact us through various channels to exchange ideas on how to optimize and promote STEAMed education. By doing this, other teams or external entities can easily build upon our work.

## 8 Conclusion

In summary, we have developed an innovative educational concept, **STEAMed**, based on the needs and characteristics of individuals with ASD, leveraging our team's expertise and interdisciplinary advantages. Using the iHP framework, we have thoughtfully practiced our ideas, creating replicable educational models and content. We applied commercial concepts to ensure the project's sustainability and promotion. Our project is not only about sparking interest, building knowledge, and offering career training for the ASD community but also aligns with [SDG 4: Quality Education] and represents an important step towards building a technologically advanced nation. We look forward to using diverse evaluation systems and teaching methods to move closer to science together through mutual learning and teaching. By enhancing inclusivity in the scientific community, we aim to amplify more voices in the field. We believe that **under the starry sky, we can all become scientists!**





## Draft Box

In summary, (team expansion) we have leveraged the expertise of **XX experts** along with **XX and XX's** support (*perhaps these should appear on the acknowledgment page?*). We have conducted courses for **XX participants**, interviews with **XX participants**, and surveys for **XX participants**.

Based on the needs and characteristics of individuals with ASD, we utilized our team's professional expertise and interdisciplinary advantages to propose an innovative teaching concept called **STEAMed** (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, Mathematics, and Medicine). In collaboration with existing public welfare resources, we designed a series of educational materials tailored to their needs, employing a multi-level teaching approach (*the logic of these short phrases might be a bit disjointed*). We launched a series of branded science activities, including the "Star Wishes Picture Book Library" (*we might want to come up with catchy English names for the other initiatives; Ziming suggested removing this part*). Various surveys indicate that our educational efforts have achieved positive results.

Ziming’s interview with Rainbow Rain could include a collage of all the Tencent Meeting screenshots in the shared document.

(*Mention above that Zhanlan also forwarded it*).

"STEAMed" will be delivered through meticulously designed and polished experiential courses.

Various surveys indicate that our educational efforts have achieved positive results.

**Based on literature, interviews, and personal interaction with ASD children**, we continuously explore new course topics and design educational content. In each course, we guide participants to explore a relatively broad "scientific question," aiming to enhance their proficiency in **Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Medicine**. We have designed a specialized "STEAMed toolkit for ASD teaching," which includes carefully curated "teaching guidance materials" and "handmade teaching aids." Through hands-on experience, ASD children can explore scientific questions and develop a better understanding of science.

### 3.7 STEAMed and the Diversity of ASD People (Multi-Level Teaching)

Rainbow Village + Zhanyi

Rainbow Village integrates the unique advantages of its park, which includes both a nursing home and a rehabilitation center for individuals with intellectual disabilities, and has upgraded its "co-care for the elderly and disabled" service model. It has become **China's first** and **only** institution to provide full-life-cycle care, from rehabilitation for special needs children, to vocational training for older youth with special needs, to family elder care.

In response to the diverse needs within the ASD community, we adopted a **multi-level teaching** design. As the spectrum suggests, ASD includes various levels of severity, with differing IQ levels, learning abilities, and language skills across groups. For those at a relative disadvantage, it is necessary to further simplify course content, reduce difficulty, and emphasize reinforcement and repetition during teaching. Additionally, individuals of different age groups have different needs. For younger children, companionship is more crucial, supplemented with appropriate enlightenment. For older individuals, the focus should be on vocational skills to better integrate them into society. Therefore, we need to **tailor the teaching content and difficulty** based on the patients' opinions, needs, and values.

Afterward, we conducted online interviews or in-person visits to several autism rehabilitation institutions in Shanghai, each specializing in either younger or older patients. They provided specific suggestions for "multi-level teaching design" from their respective perspectives.

### 3 Our Themes and Brands

**Based on literature, interviews, and personal interaction with ASD children**, we created and carried out multiple rounds of courses around the following themes and activities. Each course incorporates various disciplines, teaching methods, and DBTL, ensuring alignment with STEAMed. Detailed lesson plans and materials are attached for future reference.

---

### 3.1 "Star Wishes Picture Book Library": Genetics and Synthetic Biology

Last year, our team designed two [picture books](https://2023.igem.wiki/fudan/education/#feed-curious-minds) for children, which received sustained positive feedback. In our conversations with the founder of Tongle and children's book editors at our university Press, we learned that adding more storytelling elements can help children, including ASD patients, better understand knowledge. Thus, we decided to launch our first lesson based on these two picture books.

(*Ziming to supplement with figure and publisher*).

The **Senior Business Director at the Beijing Rainbow Village International Care and Wellness Center** mentioned that **“picture books are a great model”** and advised that course content should be **“as concrete as possible rather than abstract”** and include **“more interactive elements”**. Teachers at the Shanghai Zhanyi Children’s Service Center also emphasized that **“matching” training is commonly used to assist in autism rehabilitation and suggested that we replace "genes control traits" with "gene and trait matching".**

---

The courses included "What is a gene?", "Gene Editing", and our project this year.

The inspiration for the online game came from this.

Further improvements to be made.

We are also in the process of writing another children's science book.

---

### 3.2 "Experimental Exploration": Neuroscience and the Five Senses

Brain science: Understanding ourselves and differences. Everyone's brain operates differently, and these differences in brain function are one of the roots of scientific innovation.

Artwork from section 2.3.1 also inspired our Star Children’s interest in human science and neuroscience.

---

### 3.3 "Life Creation": Oral Medicine

Our team member, Chen Xueting, collaborated with the School of Stomatology’s Dali Hailing.

Star Child feedback: "Making toothpaste is like making coffee."

Oral medicine: We learned that Star Children...

---

### 3.4 "": Artificial Intelligence

Hongcheng to handle the links.

Star Children associated many ideas with careers like chefs and baristas.

---

### 3.5 Summary and Outlook

We created both simple and advanced versions. We piloted them at two public welfare organizations before conducting trials at a special education school (*should we make up a specific "col" to make this look less fake?*), further validating the courses.

(*Innovative point*) Each teaching method or brand theme is also applicable to other teaching content (*laying the foundation for future endeavors*).

It's not just about teaching, it's also about companionship.

---

In the future, we plan to teach first aid, hygiene, and physiological knowledge (*could AI help with this?*), and we are reconsidering sex education (which was rejected, but we’d like to revisit it).

---

The role of music (*could we pretend we designed a song?*).

---

### 4 DBTL

Referencing iHP and the Xiangbo project proposal, which includes a flowchart drawn by Ziming.

---

Earlier we could add:

To find teaching subjects, we reached out to multiple institutions. We eventually selected two organizations and one special education school. After a pilot run, we reached a consensus with the special education school and formed close relationships with the children there. The older children were more focused on integrating their existing social skills, with analogies to their daily lives like being a barista or chef.

After the pilot, we worked with two institutions respectively.
