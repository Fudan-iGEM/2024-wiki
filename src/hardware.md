Wastewater treatment and energy recovery are becoming global concerns with the increase of human activities and substantial consumption of fossil fuels. Even in Antarctica, the biggest untouched wilderness on our planet, wastewater treatment are urgently needed with the presence of 44 permanently manned research stations ([Figure 1](#figa))[^1].

However, ordinary biological filtration devices are typically designed with rigid structures and sizes. This inflexibility leads to high cost and great challenges in satisfying the vast and various demands of wastewater treatment in remote and off-grid areas, because of the lack of infrastructure, limited funding or difficulty in implementing and maintaining facilities. For example, transferring devices to Antarctica is not easy due to unusual constraints of remoteness, isolation, tough weather and other local conditions. Therefore, most countries have chosen processes that use biofilms[^2]. 

In today's wastewater treatment industry, different kinds of contemporary biofilm reactors have been created ([Figure 2](#figb)). However, they still have limitations. The fluidized bed biofilm reactor (FBBR), for instance, consumes substantial energy due to the frequent collisions of its biofilm-coated particles. And the membrane biofilm reactor (MBfR) is more susceptible to contamination, which can lead to a shortened lifespan[^3].

We analyze all these limitations and come up with our own solution using carbon nanotubes (CNTs). CNTs possess unique physicochemical and morphological characteristics, excellent adsorption capabilities, and permeability, showing significant potential in various areas[^4]. We have designed an innovative fiber structure based on carbon nanotubes, which can not only carry and nourish our engineered bacteria but also be woven into any required shape and size according to actual needs. In practical application scenarios, we load the engineered bacteria onto our designed fibers and weave them into a form that perfectly matches the target device. With this fiber structure, implated with our engineered bacteria expressing [BBa_K5115067](https://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K5115067) and [BBa_K5115068](https://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K5115068), deployed in the wastewater treatment device, we can effectively achieve the recovery of nickel.

Compared to traditional filtration devices and biofilm reactors, our customized fiber boasts **advantages**. The reversibility of our fiber weaving process allows for recycling and reuse, effectively extending the product's lifespan and release the environmental burden. Futhermore, the fiber's construction is characterized by low energy consumption. Our customized fiber serves as a platform that bridges [our engineered bacteria](/fudan/part-collection) to practical applications and offers an efficient, environmentally friendly new strategy for wastewater treatment.


## Fiber Design

Our fiber uses carbon nanotubes as a skeleton and agarose gel are wrapped around the nanotubes. Subsequently, we assemble several carbon nanotubes into bundles through a spiral extrusion method, generating the carbon nanotube-agarose gel (aCNT) composite fiber, which provides a growth platform for [our engineered bacteria](/fudan/part-collection). We referenced the method for preparing graphene composite microwires by [Professor Hyung-Jun Koo](https://kooslab.seoultech.ac.kr/subList/20000000791)[^5] and the method for preparing high-performance fiber electrodes by [Professor Peng Huisheng](https://penglab.fudan.edu.cn) in our university[^6], and made adjustments so that our composite fibers have good performance while carrying bacteria. We actually adjusted the ratio of the two components in the solution to optimize the way agarose gel to encapsulate the carbon nanotubes, making it easier for bacteria to attach. The aCNT composite fiber works as a carrier that allows the bacteria to perform normal life activities and engage in recovering nickel ([Figure 3](#fig1)).

### Section 1: Constructing aCNT Composite Fibers

#### Laboratory Preparation:

1. Heat a 2.0 g suspension of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNT) (3% by weight in water) to approximately 100 degrees Celsius. Stir continuously for 5 minutes. 
2. Add 40 mg/50 ml of agarose to the solution and stir for 30 minutes while maintaining the temperature. 
3. Transfer the hot liquid suspension containing MWNT and agarose into a 5-mL syringe equipped with a 多少粗的G needle, and form hydrogel threads by extruding through the needle. 
4. Dry the hydrogel threads at room temperature for 12 hours to form aCNT composite fibers ([Figure 4](#fig2)) [^7].

</div>


#### Industrial Preparation:

Use the apparatus shown in [Figure 5](#fig3), which contains an agarose gel solution. Pass the multi-walled carbon nanotube through the apparatus, adjusting the diameter of the inlets and outlets to control the diameter of the fibers. Heat the carbon nanotube to approximately 100 degrees Celsius and cool it down quickly to solidify the agarose gel on the surface of the carbon nanotube.

### Section 2: Loading the Bacteria

Use a spinning machine to spiral our composite fibers into bundles and weave them into the desired size and shape.

Soak the woven fiber material in bacterial solution. Stand for 30 minutes to facilitate the adsorption of bacteria onto the surface of fiber. The agarose gel provides certain nutrients, ensuring the survival of bacteria on the fibers for a period of time. Therefore, we successfully constructed our fiber-bacteria system ([Figure 6](#fig4)).

### Section 3: Application Scenarios

Our aCNT composite fibers can be used in multiple scenarios. In industrial environments, our bacteria loaded composite fiber mesh can be placed inside the wastewater treatment device ([Figure 7](#fig7)). Engineered bacteria on the fiber [absorb](https://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K5115068) and [reduce](https://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K5115067) nickel ions as the wastewater flows through the fiber mesh.

In natural water bodies, we can weave the fiber into nets similar to fishing nets. Once fixed to the banks of rivers or wooden poles in the water, the fiber nets can naturally hang into the water and achieve purification ([Figure 8](#fig8)).

## Initial Testing

We purchased pure multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNT) from Shenzhen SuiHeng Technology. and prepared a 3% suspension. We then followed the protocol from the article to create the aCNT composite fiber. However, our initial product failed to obtain the desired toughness and exhibited a uneven texture and thickness. We suspected that the this outcome was due to insufficient stirring and inconsistent application of force during the extrusion process.

Therefore, we decided to stir the mixture with a upgraded Magnetic Stirrer (LKTC-B1-T) for a full hour and used a pump to apply a steady force during the extrusion process. These adjustments led to a more homogeneous texture in the fiber, but the issue of toughness persisted.

After reviewing related literature, we concluded that the suspension ratio required optimization. After conducting a series of concentration gradient experiments, we selected the ratio of 0.5g MWNT/50ml water. After heating for 5 minutes, add 500mg/50ml agarose in the solution and keep stirring for 30 minutes, during which it transforms into a paste-like consistency. Finally, we succeededly created a thin, long black fiber.
