## TBA

<span>The graph shows the percentage of Ni²⁺ concentration absorbed by <em>E. coli</em> expressing indicated modules (<em>E. coli</em><br><small>strain: BL21 DE3). Ni²⁺ uptake was calculated based on the difference between initial and final concentrations in the supernatant, divided by 100 mg/L. The single bacteria colony was picked and grow over night to reach optical density (OD₆₀₀) > 1. Prepare a sealed 25-mL LB culture in a 250-mL bottle, with: 100 µL overnight bacteria liquid culture, 25 µg/mL Kan, 1 mM methyl viologen dichloride, 100 mg/L NiCl<sub>2</sub>, bubbled with ~250 mL 5.6% hydrogen gas (slowly, with hand shaking, about 5 minutes). Culture for 30 hours, at 37°C with rotating speed 220 rpm. Four biological replicates were performed for each condition, and error bars represent the standard errors of the means (SEM) of these replicates. Plain BL21 DE3 was used as control. None of the four bacteria with U module was able to grow during overnight culture if induced with 1 mM IPTG, only 1 F module grow. Additional 1 mM IPTG was added into the 25-mL culture of "F induced". ANOVA test shows that all constructs increase Ni²⁺ uptake significantly compared to the control. P value was calculated using Dunnett’s post test.</small></span>
