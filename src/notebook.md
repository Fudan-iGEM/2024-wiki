## March

<p><small style="color: gray">👤 Participants: All members</small></p>

In March, we have already embarked on an extensive literature review focusing on the initial three project topics we had proposed. However, we encountered challenges in identifying significant breakthroughs within these domains. The experimental design limitations associated with these topics left us feeling that they lacked the potential to evoke a "wow" factor. Consequently, we made the decision to temporarily set aside our original brainstorming concepts and turned our attention to the **exploration of fresh perspectives**.

Our new directions encompassed various exciting areas, such as **the utilization of ribozyme**, **the investigation of bubble-forming proteins**, **the innovative application of biofilm**, and **the exploration of a mechanical stress-induced kill switch**. To catalyze our exploration, we diligently delved into relevant literature and initiated the design of plasmids within these novel directions, seeking the spark of inspiration to redefine our project.

<p><small style="color: gray">📅 Date: May. 21st - May. 26th<br>👤 Participants: All members</small></p>

On the evening of May 21st, we convened an **in-person meeting** aimed at evaluating the feasibility and novelty of our brainstormed project ideas. Following four months of rigorous brainstorming and extensive data research, we reached a consensus to kickstart our project journey with a focus on the unique microbial structure of biofilms. During this meeting, we delved into discussions about potential application scenarios and use cases for biofilms.

On May 26th, our team continued the discussion, focusing on the application scenarios of bacterial membranes. Drawing inspiration from Earth's primary succession processes, we noted how lichens, in environments initially devoid of vegetation, secrete organic acids to expedite rock weathering, thereby facilitating soil formation and community succession.

As we explored the structural intricacies of lichens and their underlying mechanisms, we envisioned potential applications not only on Earth's barren landscapes like sand dunes, volcanic rocks, and glacial mud but also in outer space environments.

To delve deeper into our project's feasibility, we took the proactive step of **drafting a project description and reaching out via email to teachers with expertise in ecology and microbiology**. Our objective was to glean insights into Earth's primary successional processes and the unique characteristics of lichens

He is mainly engaged in **the development and industrialization of droplet microfluidic systems.** As a senior instructor in entrepreneurship, Mr. Zhang always offers his students extensive and innovative insights into the development of the biological industry. [We had lunch with Mr. Zhang](/human-practices/#dr-jingwei-zhang-a-unique-view-in-the-industry-of-synthetic-biology) and **shared our opinions on the industry of synthetic biology.**  Mr. Zhang pointed out that the subjective agency of living creatures could potentially join hands with synthetic biology techniques.  He believed that the combination of artificial BioBricks and the well-evolved genetic system of our chassis would further unleash the potential of synthetic biology.  From this perspective, there remains full potential to improve efficiency and reduce the cost in the development of the synthetic biology industry.

We plan to engineer *E. coli* for oxalic acid production, seeking solutions for altering metabolic pathways while safeguarding *E. coli*'s survival. Therefore, we had **[extensive online discussions](/collaborations/#with-cau-china-project-design)** with [CAU iGEM 2023](https://2024.igem.wiki/cau-china/), with expertise in this area, regarding the feasibility and operational details of their oxalate module (heterologous expression of *obcA* and *obcB* genes under a single promoter and the addition of FpOAR to enhance *E. coli*'s viability in the presence of oxalic acid).

## October

<p><small style="color: gray">📅 Date: Oct. 1st <br>👤 Participants: Zhe Dong, Qingying Yang, Xiaohan Jiang</small></p>

We invited children to participate in our [**reading activities**](/education/#painting-our-genes-a-picture-book-series-for-kids), guiding them through the picture books, encouraging them to contemplate the questions, and complete interactive tasks in the books. This approach allowed us to not only promote synthetic biology by distributing our books but also receive authentic feedback from children, which helped us continually improve our books.
