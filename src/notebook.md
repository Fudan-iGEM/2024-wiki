## January

From January 8 to 17, 2024, Fudan iGEM 2024 held a ten-day workshop on synthetic biology and the iGEM competition. Goals included 1) Sharing experiences from Fudan iGEM 2022 and 2023 members to prepare new members with essential skills and knowledge while allowing them to select courses based on interest; 2) Ice-breaking among new members to build effective communication; 3) Encouraging new ideas for 2024 through team discussions and critiques.4ï¼‰co-cultivating cyanobacteria with Escherichia coli and conducted experiments on bacterial antifreeze and desiccation resistance.

## February 

During the Chinese New Year, our team researched past iGEM projects based on roles and summarized findings in late February, enhancing our understanding of the handbook and teamwork. We split into two groups to advance the remaining topics from winter training and brainstorm new project ideas, including [E.co](http://e.co/). Sponge for silkworms and microbial engineering for metal extraction. Regular meetings helped refine project designs and allocate tasks, ensuring effective team collaboration and role distribution.

## March

In March, we conducted further research on the two projects selected during the winter training.

Microbial engineering for metal extraction focused on enhancing Nickel absorption,  reducing Nickel exclusion and mitigating Nickel Toxicity. Eco. Sponge project teams focused on surface display techniques, safety and so on.

Additionally, we advanced the commercial plan for Eco. Sponge secured a third prize at the "Excellence Cup" competition.

Meanwhile, efforts in autism education included revising a picture book based on expert feedback and testing its effectiveness in classroom settings.

## April

On April 5th, team members visited an art exhibit at Fudan University showcasing artwork by autistic children. On April 18th, after two months of research, we selected "MINERAL: Microparticle Integration for Nickel Extraction and Reusable Applications" as the Fudan iGEM 2024 project topic.

## May

On May 2nd, we finalized the 14-member lineup and redistributed roles while discussing various project aspects, such as nickel ion binding, transport, and coexistence with nitrifying bacteria. On May 4th, discussions with other universities revealed a similarity with BIT's project, prompting a reevaluation of our project background. On May 10th, we explored gas vesicles in E. coli, nickel ion conversion, and the potential for nitrification and denitrification. On May 19th, further discussions focused on symbiotic systems, metal-binding proteins, and new application directions, refining their project approach and educational outreach. On May 24th, we participated in the Stargazing Cultural and Art Festival and promoted our project during the event.

## July

We conducted a preliminary sample purification to remove interfering substances. and led STEAMed educational activities, attended the China iGEM Community Conference where we won awards, interviewed Professor Zhu on nanoparticle safety, prepared for molecular cloning, and engaged with high school students and Professor Don W. Cleveland in scientific discussions.

## August

We interviewed experts from various fields and actively engaged with students from different schools to gather suggestions for project improvements. Meanwhile, our wet lab and dry lab were also ongoing.

## September - October

We finalized the authorship for different web pages and divided the tasks to start writing the pages and summarizing previous work. Meanwhile, we began analyzing wet lab data and further refining the dry lab work until the final deadline.
