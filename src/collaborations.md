We communicated with institutions colleges, companies, and governments to improve the project design and find valuable applications (see more details on our [Integrated Human Practices](/fudan/human-practices/) page).

Meanwhile,  we collaborated with nonprofit organizations and clubs in STEAMed activities (see more information on our [Inclusivity](/fudan/inclusivity/) page).

We sincerely appreciate the support and help from all sectors of our local society. As the saying goes, *'A single spark can start a prairie fire.'* We passionately believe that our collaborations can pave the way for an even brighter, more inspiring future for synthetic biology.
