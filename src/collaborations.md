## With Institutions, Collages and Companies

几年几月几日 we interviewed experts from the [Chinese National Engineering Research Center for Control & Treatment of Heavy Metal Pollution at Central South University](https://zjsgczx.csu.edu.cn/) to obtain guidance 要链接去DBTL on our project design and application.

几年几月几日 we communicated with members from  [CUS-China 2024](https://2024.igem.wiki/csu-china/) and [HNU-China 2024](https://2024.igem.wiki/hnu-china/). 干了什么

Additionally, we visited companies including [GEM](https://www.gem.com.cn/gb/index.html) and [Suzhou Yisibei Chemical Environmental Protection Equipment Company](https://www.cps88.cn/) to seek advice from industral engineers on our project [implementation](/fudan/implementation). See more details on our [Integrated Human Practice](/fudan/human-practices) page.

## With Nonprofit Orgnizations

We organized a series of high-quality inclusive activities, which would not have been possible without the invaluable support of [Light Of Rainbow](https://www.asd-home.cn/jgz2694/), [INDIGO](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/1oH0URp3To4R0A3HJnZc1Q) and [Shanghai Putuo Zhanyi Children's Intelligence Service Center](https://www.zhanyiertong.org) as our activity partners. We designed a series of courses for children with autism, with *Rainbow Rain* providing the teaching venues and participants, as well as assisting in recruiting volunteers for the activities.

In collaboration with *INDIGO*, we conducted science education classes and origami activities to introduce synthetic biology, artificial intelligence, and brain science to children with autism. We also enhanced our courses through hands-on DIY games. See more details on our [Inclusivity](/fudan/inclusivity) page.

## With Clubs in Fudan

We collaborate with FDU Nanshangu 需要公众号链接 and Fudan Red Cross 需要公众号链接 in [Inclusivity](/fudan/inclusivity) , poster visualization, and other areas to promote our project and [synthetic biology](https://igem.org/). With the help of these local clubs, we were able to recruit event participates, collect feedback on our events, and improve based on the feedback.
