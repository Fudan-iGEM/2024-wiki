## With Institution, Collage and Company: Project Design

We interviewed experts from the [Chinese National Engineering Research Center for Control & Treatment of Heavy Metal Pollution at Central South University]([国家重金属污染防治工程技术研究中心 (csu.edu.cn)](https://zjsgczx.csu.edu.cn/)) to obtain guidance on project design and application, we also communicated with members from  [CUS-China 2024 iGEM]([Home | CSU-CHINA - iGEM 2024](https://2024.igem.wiki/csu-china/)) and [HNU-China 2024 iGEM]([Home | HNU-china - iGEM 2024](https://2024.igem.wiki/hnu-china/)). Additionally, we visited companies such as [GEM]([格林美股份有限公司 (gem.com.cn)](https://www.gem.com.cn/gb/index.html)) and [Suzhou in times of chemical environmental protection equipment technology company]([工业废水处理-污水处理设备系统工程-污水处理公司厂家-依斯倍环保 (cps88.cn)](https://www.cps88.cn/)) to seek advice from engineers on project implementation.(see more details on our [Integrated HP]( [Inclusivity](/fudan/team#xujie-tan2024.igem.wiki/fudan/inclusivity/#what-did-we-do-for-inclusivity)2024.igem.wiki/fudan/human-practices.html)) page

## With Nonprofit Orgnizations: Event Organizer

We organized a series of high-quality inclusive activities, which would not have been possible without the invaluable support of [Light Of Rainbow](https://www.asd-home.cn/jgz2694/) , [INDIGO]([一个有关爱和信念的故事，她比烟花灿烂 (qq.com)](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/1oH0URp3To4R0A3HJnZc1Q)) and [Shanghai Putuo District Zhanyi Children's Intelligence Service Center](www.zhanyiertong.org) as our activity partners. We designed a series of courses for children with autism, with Rainbow Rain providing the teaching venues and participants, as well as assisting in recruiting volunteers for the activities. In collaboration with INDIGO, we conducted science education classes and origami activities to introduce synthetic biology, artificial intelligence, and brain science to children with autism. We also enhanced the appeal of the courses through hands-on DIY games. (see more details on our [Inclusivity](/[Inclusivity | Fudan (igem.wiki)](/fudan/team#xujie-tan2024.igem.wiki/fudan/inclusivity/)) page).

## With clubs and associations on Fudan campus

We collaborate with FDU Nanshangu and Fudan Red Cross in [Inclusivity](/[Inclusivity | Fudan (igem.wiki)](/fudan/team#xujie-tan2024.igem.wiki/fudan/inclusivity/)), visualization, and many other areas to promote our projects and expand the impact of scientific fields such as synthetic biology. With the help of these organizations, we were able to recruit event personnel, collect feedback on the event, and improve based on the feedback.
