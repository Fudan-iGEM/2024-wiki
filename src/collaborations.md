We communicated with institutions colleges, companies, and governments to improve the project design and find valuable applications (see more details on our [Integrated Human Practices](/fudan/human-practices/) page).

Meanwhile,  we collaborated with nonprofit organizations and clubs in STEAMed activities (see more information on our [Inclusivity](/fudan/inclusivity/) page).
