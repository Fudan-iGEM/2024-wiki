## Sustainable Development by Nickel Recycling 

Nickel, essential for electric vehicle batteries, is crucial for modern infrastructure and clean energy technologies. However, current recycling methods are inefficient and environmentally damaging, impeding progress toward sustainable development. 

Our project, MINERAL, developes a system that recycles nickel from waste and transforms it into harmless microparticles, which not only minimizes the environmental impact of nickel industry but also reduces the need for future nickel mining. This process aligns with the Sustainable Development Goals and supports bioremediation efforts, reinforcing our determination to a greener future.

### SDG 7 Affordable and Clean Energy

The 7th SDG ‘Affordable and Clean Energy’ emphasizes the need for reliable and sustainable energy solutions. 

Our project, MINERAL, transforms nickel into harmless microparticles, making it both affordable and environmental friendly for future use. By simplifying the utilization of nickel, our project reduces costs associated with traditional nickel extraction and promotes a sustainable approach to clean energy.

### SDG 9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure

The 9th SDG ‘Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure’ aims at building resilient infrastructure, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization and fostering innovation.

Our project, MINERAL, makes recycling nickel energy-efficient, which supports the development of advanced technologies and infrastructure, particularly in regions where resource scarcity and environmental degradation pose significant challenges. We contacted a battery recycling company, and they saw real potential in our project for making a positive impact in the industry, supporting infrastructure growth while protecting our planet’s resources.

### SDG 12 Responsible Consumption and Production

The 12th SDG 'Responsible Consumption and Production' calls for sustainable patterns in how we use resources and manage waste, aiming to minimize the environmental impact of production and consumption.

MINERAL supports responsible consumption by making nickel recovery eco-friendly. It also contributes to sustainable production by providing a more reliable and less destructive alternative to traditional nickel production. This will foster a circular economy and promote more responsible practices in resource management.

## Sustainable Development by Stopping Nickel Pollution 

Nickel is a major pollutant due to inefficient recycling practices and destructive mining methods.

Our project, MINERAL, is a system that recovers and transforms nickel into harmless microparticles and addresses this issue head-on.

### SDG 6 Clean Water and Sanitation

The 6th SDG 'Clean Water and Sanitation' puts emphasis on the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.

MINERAL offers a more energy-efficient and eco-friendly approach compared to traditional, wasteful recycling processes, reducing the harmful environmental impact of nickel mining and industrial wastewater. MINERAL supports cleaner water and better sanitation, directly advancing global efforts to ensure sustainable water management and protect our water resources for future generations. Please refer to and [Description](https://2024.igem.wiki/fudan/description.html) for more information.

### SDG 14 Life Below Water

The 14th SDG 'Life Below Water' targets at conserving and sustainably using the oceans, seas and marine resources. 

Mining and industrial processes release nickel into rivers, lakes, and oceans, leading to severe pollution that harms aquatic life and disrupts marine food chains. MINERAL helps mitigate the toxic effects of nickel in oceans and protect marine biodiversity, maintaining the health of our oceans. 

We also recognized that releasing E. coli into water body could harm aquatic life. We prioritize safety by studying the behavior of *C.elegans*; they show no significant abnormalities when consuming our microparticles and microbes (E. coli + hydrogenase) but are affected in nickel-rich growth media. Please refer to and [Safety](https://2024.igem.wiki/fudan/safety/) for more information.

Additionally, we’ve developed hardware that allows E. coli to grow on fibers, preventing its spread in water, effectively addressing metal issues while avoiding creating new problems. Please refer to and [Hardware](https://2024.igem.wiki/fudan/hardware/) for more information

## Sustainable Development by Inclusive Education

### SDG 4 Quality Education

The 4th SDG 'Quality Education' is the cornerstone that enables the achievement of many Sustainable Development Goals. 

We focus on delivering biology education across the K-12 spectrum, actively gathering feedback from students to refine our methods in each teaching session continually. 

Please refer to [Education](https://2024.igem.wiki/fudan/education) for more information.

We believe that education should embrace inclusivity, ensuring that no one is excluded from scientific learning due to barriers like physical conditions and imbalanced resources. We recognized that many autistic individuals possess the cognitive abilities to grasp scientific concepts but their potentials are constantly igonored because they usually don't give active feedback in ordinary lecture. Therefore, we developed specialized STEAMed programs tailored to them. We strive to create more engaging and interactive teaching approaches to meet their unique needs—an area currently underserved by existing educational resources.

### SDG 11 Sustainable Cities and Communities

The 11th SDG 'Sustainable Cities and Communities' aims at making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable.

As urban populations surge and cities expand rapidly, the pressure on infrastructure and resources intensifies. MINERAL addresses this issue by recycling nickel—a critical component in urban technologies.

Please refer to [Description](https://2024.igem.wiki/fudan/description.html) for more information.

In addition, our inclusive education spreads knowledge among diverse communities. By offering tailored STEAMed programs and modular teaching tools, we aim to empower students across various backgrounds, contributing to a more sustainable communities for all.

## Sustainable Development by Incorporation

### SDG 8 Decent Work and Economic Growth

The 8th SDG 'Decent Work and Economic Growth' appeals for promoting sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all.

The implementation of MINERAL create new job opportunities in the fields of biotechnology and environmental management. By fostering partnerships with industry leaders, we support a vibrant job market and contribute to the growth of the green economy.

Companies invest significant resources to comply with environmental regulations. By using MINERAL, they can save money and redirect those funds into investments and other areas. This ultimately contributes to economic growth.

### SDG 17 Partnerships for the Goals

The 17th SDG 'Partnerships for the Goals' encourages strengthening the means of implementation and revitalizing the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development.

Our initiative to develop a biological solution for nickel recycling relies on strong, multi-faceted collaborations. Recognizing that a single team cannot tackle global challenges alone, we actively engage with a diverse network of stakeholders.

We have forged valuable partnerships with industry leaders, academic experts and other igemers who share the same aim with us to Refine our technology and understand market dynamics. Our collaboration with a battery recycling company has provided practical insights, enhancing the feasibility of our project. We also aim to raise awareness and garner support for our mission through promotional activities.
