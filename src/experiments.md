## Ni^2+^ Measurement

### Fabrication method of Ni^2+^ Standard Curve

#### I. Principle 

1. In an ammonium citrate-ammonia water medium, iodine acts as an oxidizing agent and promotes the reaction between nickel ions and dimethylglyoxime , which form a red wine-colored complex.
2. The formed complex has a maximum absorption at the wavelength of 530 nm, thus a spectrophotometer can be used to measure its absorbance.
3. By fabricating the Ni^2+^ standard curve, the concentration of nickel in the sample can be quantitatively determined.



#### II. Reagents

1. 500 g/L tribasic ammonium citrate solution, 100 mL system, add 2 mL each time: Weigh 50 g ammonium citrate solidity, dissolve in distilled water, and transfer to a 100 mL volumetric flask, dilute to the scale and shake.
2. 0.05 mol/L Iodine solution, 100 mL system, add 1 mL each time: Weigh 1.27 g Iodine, add to a small amount of distilled water containing 2.5 g Potassium iodide (KI) , grind and dissolve, then dilute to 100 mL with distilled water. *Actual amount depends on the weight of a small iodine bead, and this protocol is used as the minimum configuration unit*.
3. 5g/L Dimethylglyoxime, 105mL system, use 2 mL each time: Dissolve 0.525 g dimethylglyoxime in 50 mL ammonia water, dissolve in distilled water, and transfer to a 100 mL volumetric flask, dilute to the scale and shake.
4. 50g/L Na2EDTA, 100 mL system, use 2 mL each time: Weigh 5 g Na2EDTA solidity, dissolve in distilled water, and transfer to a 100 mL volumetric flask, dilute to the scale and shake.
5. 10 mg/L Nickel standard stock solution, 5 mL system: Weigh 0.20325 g nickel chloride hexahydrate (NiCl~2~·6H~2~O),  dissolve in 5 mL ddH~2~O.

For each EP tube, shake well after adding reagents and set aside for 5 minutes. Shake before measuring each tube and rinse the cuvette. Then measure its absorbance at wavelength A530nm. Use the color-developing solution without Ni as a blank control.



## TEM Sample Preparation



## Phage Resistance

1. Cultivate the bacteria for approximately 4 hours to reach the logarithmic growth phase, adjusting the OD~600~ to 0.5.
2. Take 1 mL of bacterial culture and add phages to achieve multiplicity of infections (MOIs) of 0.5, 1, and 2 (E. coli concentration is considered to be 1 x 10^8^ at OD~600~ = 1, and the phage concentration is 2 x 10^13^/mL; use after diluting 1000-fold).
3. Incubate at 37°C for 30 minutes while pre-warming the agar plates.
4. Take 150 µL of the culture and spread it onto the plate.
5. Incubate overnight at 37°C.



## CFU Counting

| Dilution ratio          | Solution Proportions                                         |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| The First Diluted Tube  | 500 μL Experimental Groups Bacterial Solution (OD~600~ 1 = 10^8^/mL) + 9.5 mL ddH~2~O |
| The second Diluted Tube | 100 μL First Diluted Solution + 0.9 mL ddH~2~O               |
| Final Dilution ratio    | 1 : 200                                                      |

1. Dilute the bacterial culture sample (100 μL) to 1:200 and take 100 μL from the third diluted tube to perform plate culturing.
2. After incubating at 37°C for 16 hours, for each sample, CFU count = the number of colonies on the agar plate × 200.
