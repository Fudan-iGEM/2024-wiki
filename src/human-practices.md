"Human Practices" refers to iGEM teams' proactive efforts to assess how their work interacts with the world and the broader impacts it creates. MINERAL addressed the industrial issue of nickel wastewater pollution, aiming to contribute to a better planet and future for humanity. However, this vision evolved through the project's lifecycle. Our HP efforts helped us navigate challenges, fostering connections with esteemed scientists, wastewater treatment enterprises, government bodies, and like-minded teams, all of which played pivotal roles in key decisions throughout the project.

Next, join us as we embark on an exciting HP journey together!



## 1. Preparations: Background Research

### 1.1 From Wild Imagination to Nickel

During the brainstorming phase, Fudan iGEMers showcased their boundless creativity. Through discussions and idea exchanges, the team decided to focus on a technology for treating nickel ion solutions, naming it MEME. This decision was based on several factors, with the importance, scarcity, and specificity of nickel resources being the most fundamental considerations.



### 1.2 Nickel: So Important and Unique

We discovered that nickel is becoming increasingly vital in modern life. Extracted from deep within the earth, nickel supports rapid technological advancements through industrial manufacturing. According to the 2023 Global Mineral Resources Assessment Report, the known global nickel reserves stand at 27.466 billion tons, with a 2022 global production of 3.28 million tons[^1] only 350,000 of which were recycled[^2]. At this rate, we could run out of nickel by 2118.



### 1.3 Early Stages: From Nickel to Nickel Recycling

A news report drew our attention to the development trends of new energy vehicles in China, inspiring the initial application scenario for our project: nickel metal recovery from new energy vehicle batteries.

With this, we gathered all the essential background information we needed, officially embarking on our journey.



## 2. Methods for integrated Human Practice

### 2.1 DBTL in iHP

Will be updated in the next version.



### 2.2 AREA for iHP

Will be updated in the next version.



### 2.3 Methods Selection in our iHP

Will be updated in the next version.



## 3. Topic Refine & Background

The foundation of the project was built upon comprehensive literature and online research, giving rise to the creation of MINERAL.

However, after identifying and reflecting on this scientific issue, based on simple synthetic biology components, needed further engagement and updates through communication with frontline stakeholders. 



Therefore, with questions and aspirations about nickel recovery, we visited Mr. Xiong Sicong on April 26, a former undergraduate in life sciences, an iGEM enthusiast, and currently employed at Polestar Automotive.

<h3 style="font-size: 26px;">3.1 Discussing with Mr. Xiong</h3>

</p>  
</div>

Mr. Xiong is an expert in battery recycling, and he briefed us on the industry's current status. While 95% of metals in batteries are efficiently recycled, MEME didn‚Äôt show a clear advantage in this regard. However, Mr. Xiong highlighted three key challenges in battery recycling:

1. **High energy consumption.**
2. **Significant air and water pollution.**
3. **Lack of specificity in conventional methods.**

He praised MEME‚Äôs nickel specificity and suggested focusing on wastewater treatment in electric vehicle batteries for greater impact.

Mr. Xiong also suggested that we visit battery recycling plants or other relevant factories for further field research to gain hands-on experience and understand industry needs. 

Following his advice, we explored additional sources of nickel pollution, leading us to focus on addressing nickel contamination in wastewater from electric vehicle battery recycling. At this point, our project was named "MEME," symbolizing our goal of recycling nickel from wastewater.



 Although Mr. Xiong broadened our perspective, we remained focused on addressing nickel pollution specifically in battery manufacturing and recycling, aiming to recover nickel through nanoparticle generation.

### 3.2 Meeting with BIT-China, ShanghaiTech-China, and Tongji-China

</p>  
</div>

On May 4th, we hosted a project design exchange (Fudan-BIT-Tongji-ShanghaiTech Meeting) at Fudan University with BIT-China, ShanghaiTech-China, and Tongji-China. To our surprise, BIT-China also focused on battery issues, though they approached electric vehicle battery recycling with entirely different strategies. While their work was not centered on pollution, through in-depth discussions, we gained new insights from an engineering perspective and realized that nickel, though significant in our project, is not the primary industrial concern in battery production and recycling.



------

**These two HP efforts, along with subsequent reflections, formed a complete DBTL (Design-Build-Test-Learn) cycle. They profoundly changed our understanding of the electric vehicle battery issue, leading us to adjust both the direction of our project and the design of some components.**

</p>  
</div>

We learned about the use of nickel in chip packaging and the generation of nickel-containing wastewater. This enlightened us with a broader understanding of nickel wastewater issues.

Professor Xu Ling also mentioned that nickel plating is a common process in microelectronic chip packaging, used to form a nickel layer on chip lead frames or substrates to ensure good solderability and corrosion resistance. Nickel and other metals (such as gold) are also used in advanced packaging structures like RDL, UBM, and Bumps through electroplating.

However, in the lab, wastewater from processes like cleaning, acid washing, and nickel plating is collected but further treated by specialized wastewater departments. This highlighted the need to visit factories for deeper insights.



Since we still needed to find answers within the electric vehicle battery recycling industry, on August 9, we presented our "MEME" project during a discussion with UPower Technology.

### 3.4 Meeting with U Power

</p>  
</div>

The investment experts at UPower Technologies expressed strong interest in the MEME project but pointed out that the experimental validation is still in its early stages, making it difficult to assess its readiness for commercial application. They suggested visiting industrial battery recycling plants to bridge the gap between theory and engineering.

Moreover, UPower believes the market for new energy applications is relatively small and recommended shifting the focus toward broader issues, such as nickel-heavy metal wastewater pollution.



With this question in mind, and inspired by Mr. Xiong and the investment experts from UPower Technology, we visited Greenme (Hubei) New Energy Materials Co., Ltd. in Jingmen, China, on August 15, thanks to UPower Technology's introduction. GME is dedicated to the recycling of electric vehicle batteries and has extensive recycling experience.

### 3.5 Visit GEM victory

</p>  
</div>

We presented the partially validated "MEME" project to Greenme‚Äôs engineering experts and toured their control center, pilot lab, and full production line for battery recycling. 

The experts pointed out that nickel recovery is a small part of electric vehicle battery recycling and encouraged us to focus on addressing broader nickel wastewater pollution issues.

<div style="text-align: center;" id="fig1">
    <img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5115/ihp-zm/8-15-visit-gem-2.jpg" style="width:100%">

          <span style="color: gray">Figure 3.5.2 Visit GEM Victory 2</span>
      <br><br>
    </div>
</div>


Greenme's experts provided several technical expectations for our project:

1. **High osmotic pressure tolerance**: MEME must withstand high sodium and sulfate ions common in industrial wastewater to be effective.
2. **Specificity**: MEME's specificity should target a particular stage in industrial battery recycling, ideally paired with a systematic hardware design.
3. **Nickel nanoparticle production**: The engineers are highly interested in the production of nickel nanoparticles, which could revolutionize the inefficient process of nickel extraction from laterite ores and enable a closed-loop industry.

<div style="text-align: center;" id="fig1">
    <img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5115/ihp-zm/8-15-visit-gem-3.jpg" style="width:100%">

      <br><br>
    </div>
</div>

Greenme's experts also suggested that our perspective should be broader, focusing on industrial nickel wastewater treatment. This includes addressing nickel pollution in industries like electroplating, stainless steel production, and even environmental pollution control.



To gain a comprehensive understanding of these industrial nickel wastewater issues, we held an online meeting with IES Environmental Protection Technology (Suzhou) Co., Ltd. on August 27.

## 5. Measurement

After completing the basic framework of the project and conducting comprehensive literature research, the initial idea for **Measurement** was to detect changes in nickel ion concentration and observe the formation of nickel nanoparticles. However, we encountered significant challenges with these methods. The iHP work helped us overcome these difficulties and led to the development of improved **Measurement** techniques.

Between April and May, we discussed the laboratory instruments and conditions with Professor Cai Liang, the lab's PI, and based on this, we designed two **Measurement** technical approaches.

Due to limitations in laboratory conditions, the measurement of changes in nickel ion concentration will be based on a standard colorimetric method.

For the formation of nickel nanoparticles, we plan to use the magnetic properties of the nanoparticles for sorting and identification, while simultaneously utilizing UV-Vis spectrophotometry to determine the absorption peaks.



However, these methods are not enough. To find the testing methods we are looking for, we visited Professor Zhu Xiuping from the Department of Environmental Science and Engineering at Fudan University on July 16. 

### 5.1 Discuss with Professor Zhu Xiuping

<div style="text-align: center;" id="fig1">

</p>  
</div>

Professor Zhu has long been engaged in metal wastewater treatment. She guided us through the laboratory, explaining the uses and basic operating procedures of various instruments. She suggested that when analyzing the generated "nickel nanoparticles" using multi-element experimental wastewater, we should include elemental analysis to determine the composition of the metal nanoparticles, as it can be challenging to identify their elements based solely on their appearance.


Recognizing our insufficient environmental science-related experimental equipment, Professor Zhu Xiuping recommended a shared instrument platform, which would facilitate our experimental work.



After our discussion with professor Zhu, we also visit prof Feng from the Department of Chemistry at Fudan University on August 2.

### 5.2 Discuss with Professor Feng Wei

<div style="text-align: center;" id="fig1">

</p>  
</div>

Professor Feng initially dismissed our method of measuring nickel nanoparticle content using UV spectrophotometry, as the absorption peaks of organic compounds are significantly higher than those of nickel nanoparticles, making this approach unfeasible. He also mentioned that while nickel nanoparticles theoretically have magnetic properties, their magnetism is very weak, which renders that method ineffective as well.

Through further literature research and discussions with Professor Feng Wei, we opted to observe the generated nickel nanoparticles using electron microscopy. This method is more intuitive and feasible. Professor Feng also emphasized the importance of examining the oxidation state of nickel nanoparticles, encouraging us to critically consider the mention of "zero-valent nickel" in the literature.



## 5.3 Visit to the Laboratory of CNERC-CTHMP.

</p>  
</div>

On August 16, during our visit to the National Engineering Technology Research Center for Heavy Metal Pollution, we entered the scanning electron microscopy room and the transmission electron microscopy room. Doctoral and master's students from Professor Lin Zhang's research group, including Du Fangyuan, introduced us to several experimental techniques related to heavy metal wastewater treatment.


In CNERC-CTHMP, we observed specialized X-ray-based instruments capable of determining the oxidation states of elements. This inspired us to consider detection methods for metal oxidation states.



------

**The three iHP efforts collectively formed the DBTL Cycle for Measurement, guiding us in developing a comprehensive detection method and techniques. This allowed us to establish a Measurement approach focused primarily on two core technologies: standard colorimetric methods and electron microscopy observation.**

## 6 Hardware

In the initial conception of Mineral, we designed a membrane-based hardware system, hoping it would address all issues. However, after discussions and exchanges with experts from laboratories and companies, we abandoned the original idea. Through detailed discussions and evaluations, we incorporated the experts' suggestions and designed [a new hardware module](/fudan/hardware/).



### 6.1 Discussed with Professor Cai

</p>  
</div>

We explained our membrane-based hardware concept to Professor Cai, who pointed out that membranes are not suitable for large-scale industrial production and specific usage scenarios. After thorough research and discussions, we designed a bacterial membrane covering material based on specialized fibers. Bacteria can specifically adhere to this unique fiber, allowing for personalized applications of the fabric in various scenarios. This became the foundation of our hardware design.



### 6.2 Discussed with Professor Lin Zhang: MINERAL hardware for natural water bodies.

</p>  
</div>

On August 16, Professor Lin Zhang from Central South University emphasized the importance of considering the specificity and key issues of different application environments. He pointed out that our bacterial density is extremely low compared to large natural water bodies. Two problems need to be addressed: 1. Increase the contact area between MINERAL and the ions in the water; 2. Enhance the flux of water passing through MINERAL per unit time.

<div style="text-align: center;" id="fig1">

Using sponges as an example, he suggested that we could adopt a biomimetic approach to mimic how sponges filter seawater, allowing sufficient flux of seawater through the bacterial body.

After further research and discussions, we created hardware designs for natural water bodies based on mesh design. This part of the hardware design can be found in the ‚ÄúHardware‚Äù section.



### 6.3 Discussion with CPS technology experts:  the hardware design for industrial nickel wastewater pollution.

      <br><br>
    </div>
</div>

Inspired by Professor Lin Zhang, we aimed to enhance the hardware design for treating industrial nickel wastewater from an industrial perspective. 


On September 10, during our visit to the Suzhou Yisibei pilot equipment workshop, we discussed the general structure of industrial processing equipment with technical experts. We focused on chromatography columns and used this as a basis for designing MINERAL hardware suitable for industrial environments. 

<div style="text-align: center;" id="fig1">

      <br><br>
    </div>
</div>


We also considered MINERAL's placement after preliminary alkaline treatment of nickel-polluted wastewater, as it could achieve treatment precision that alkaline methods cannot, while effectively recovering nickel ions.

## 7. Dry Lab

"MINERAL" is expected to play a role in industrial settings or polluted natural water bodies. To achieve this, we conducted extensive Dry Lab work. Our iHP efforts facilitated research and discussions with various institutions.



### Write to the Shanghai Municipal Ecology and Environment Bureau to seek data and support.

In our Model design, inspired by fluid dynamics, we aim to focus on local issues and develop a model to simulate pollution diffusion. During the design process, we reached out to the Shanghai Municipal Ecology and Environment Bureau for data support and suggestions. We received a positive response from the bureau, which further motivated our Model development.



## 8. Entrepreneurship

During several communications with enterprises, they showed strong interest in MINERAL and expressed expectations for biological methods to address nickel pollution. This section can be found in the [Entrepreneurship interface](/fudan/entrepreneurship/). Our business research and design also followed the DBTL Cycle, providing valuable feedback and inspiration for project improvement.

## 10. Communicate with Peers: Improving the Project Through Meeting

The Fudan iGEM 2024 team organized two and participated in three cross-school exchange activities. Interacting with other teams provided valuable insights for reviewing our own project. We observed that teams from different backgrounds focus on various aspects of the project. Additionally, within the shared context of iGEM, we could avoid straying from synthetic biology principles, effectively identifying solutions to our challenges.

| Event                                                     | Date      | Improvement                                                  |

## 11. How the iHP work paradigm enhances education and inclusivity

Although Education and Inclusivity are not strictly part of iHP, we still utilized the DBTL-based iHP approach to engage with education experts, sociologists, and social workers. Our Education and Inclusivity activities benefited significantly from these interactions.

For a detailed account of this section, please refer to the [Education](/fudan/education/)  and [Inclusivity](/fudan/inclusivity) sections.
