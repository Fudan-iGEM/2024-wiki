## Identifying and Understanding Unmet Needs

As global awareness of environmental protection increases, the demand for sustainable resource management and the reduction of industrial pollution is growing. According to estimates by AsianMetal, **4.4 to 4.6 million tons of nickel-containing scrap** are collected annually, with a nickel content of nearly **350,000 tons**, accounting for about **1/4** of the total nickel demand. The mining and production processes of nickel have caused significant environmental damage, including deforestation, soil erosion, and water pollution. 

The Earth urgently needs effective methods to mitigate the pollution caused by the nickel mining industry.

On the other hand, current global nickel reserves are struggling to meet the growing demand from electric vehicles and other high-tech products, increasing the risk of resource depletion. ESDM has pointed out that high-grade nickel ore with a content of over **1.7%** can only sustain consumption for **7 to 10 years**. The Earth needs an efficient nickel recycling technology to extend the lifespan of nickel resources and meet the ongoing demand for nickel in the future.
