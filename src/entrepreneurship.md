## Identifying and Understanding Unmet Needs

As global awareness of environmental protection increases, the demand for sustainable resource management and the reduction of industrial pollution is growing. According to estimates by AsianMetal, **4.4 to 4.6 million tons of nickel-containing scrap** are collected annually, with a nickel content of nearly **350,000 tons**, accounting for about **1/4** of the total nickel demand. The mining and production processes of nickel have caused significant environmental damage, including deforestation, soil erosion, and water pollution. 

The Earth urgently needs effective methods to mitigate the pollution caused by the nickel mining industry.

</div>

On the other hand, current global nickel reserves are struggling to meet the growing demand from electric vehicles and other high-tech products, increasing the risk of resource depletion. ESDM has pointed out that high-grade nickel ore with a content of over **1.7%** can only sustain consumption for **7 to 10 years**. The Earth needs an efficient nickel recycling technology to extend the lifespan of nickel resources and meet the ongoing demand for nickel in the future.

</div>

However, existing nickel recycling methods are inefficient, costly, and harmful to the environment. Given the surge in nickel demand, the market shows a strong willingness to invest in a new nickel recycling system that meets the pursuit of innovation and efficiency. As a result, we have identified the potential customers for the MINERAL project as industrial manufacturers utilizing nickel, including **battery manufacturers**, **stainless steel producers**, **industrial wastewater treatment companies**, **mining companies**, and **electroplating companies**.

</div>

GEM adheres to the development philosophy of *limited resources, unlimited recycling*, committed to *eliminating pollution and regenerating resources.* They promote a circular industrial culture aimed at achieving a harmonious integration of economic value, environmental value, and social responsibility, which **aligns closely with our ideas and missions**.

【插入fig11】

GEM expressed strong interest in our project and invited us to their key mineral resource recovery research institute in **Jingmen, Hubei Province, China**, for a tour and discussions on technical collaboration.

【插入fig12】

 After assessing the actual conditions of GEM's production line, we quickly identified the most suitable processing phase for the MINERAL project. Consequently, we successfully reached a technical cooperation agreement and later received the relevant wastewater samples from GEM. After we got [result](#https://2024.igem.wiki/fudan/result) and shared it with GEM, they conveyed even stronger willingness to carry out further cooperation with us.

### Financial Analysis

<div style="text-align: center;" id="fig19">
    <img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5115/entrepreneurship/costanalysis.webp" style='width:100%'>
    <div>
    	<span style="color: gray">Figure 19: Cost Analysis of MINERAL</span>
        <br><br>
    </div>
</div>

We first analyzed the profit model for **battery recycling companies** among potential customers. 

Focusing on the most valuable materials in raw material recovery, **cobalt and nickel**, the existing hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical combined technology can recover 107.84 tons of nickel sulfate (current price: approximately \$4,500/ton) and 84.65 tons of cobalt sulfate (current price: approximately \$13,000/ton) from every 1,000 tons of used power batteries. With our microbial separation technology, production is estimated to increase by 10%-30%. Based on the current market price of industrial raw materials, the revenue from processing each ton of waste power batteries can directly amount to approximately $228,000.

Conservatively estimating that the cost of each ton of used power batteries entering the disassembly and recovery stage is about \$42,000, the battery recycling company could earn over $1.8 million annually by processing 10 tons of waste batteries, after accounting for expenses such as equipment depreciation and microbial modification costs.

Therefore, **in the sales scenario of our microbial heavy metal ion cleaner**, the customer acquisition phase has a relatively low unit price of approximately **\$280 per unit of wastewater** caused by a kilogram of waste power batteries. Each ton could yield a profit of approximately $280,000, and this could be increased by about 50% after improving production technology.

### Risks

- In the current context where environmental pollution is difficult to measure as equitably as carbon emissions, our team's biological method lacks cost advantages when heavy metal ion concentrations in wastewater are high. 
- Integrating this method into the end of chemical treatment processes also places high demands on facility infrastructure.

- The shortage of synthetic biology talent means that after selling the product, we would need to provide customers with extensive and detailed after-sales services, creating significant pressure on human resources.

- Moreover, existing nickel ion separation methods are relatively crude and inexpensive, leaving companies with little motivation to switch to biological recovery methods.

## Long-term Impacts

**Positive**:

1. Reduce mining activities, benefiting ecological protection and labor health.
2. Slow down the depletion of nickel reserves, enhancing the sustainability of global resources.
3. Decrease water pollution levels, thereby promoting the achievement of SDGs.
4. Create emerging job opportunities and markets in the bioindustry.
5. With alternative technologies in place, the government will enforce stricter environmental protection laws and regulations.

**Negative**:

1. Introducing engineered microorganisms into environmental water bodies may pose risks of gene escape and contamination, increasing the likelihood of wild bacteria developing resistance to heavy metal ions, making existing water purification methods less effective.
2. The traditional mining and metallurgy industries may face market contraction and declining employment rates, leading to frictional unemployment.
3. Unlike standardized industrial products, biological agents may exhibit significant variability between batches, resulting in unstable heavy metal removal effectiveness.
