## Identifying and Understanding Unmet Needs

As global awareness of environmental protection increases, the demand for sustainable resource management and the reduction of industrial pollution is growing. According to estimates by AsianMetal, 4.4 to 4.6 million tons of nickel-containing scrap are collected annually, with a nickel content of nearly 350,000 tons, accounting for about one-fourth of the total nickel demand. The mining and production processes of nickel have caused significant environmental damage, including deforestation, soil erosion, and water pollution. The Earth urgently needs effective methods to mitigate the pollution caused by the nickel mining industry.

On the other hand, current global nickel reserves are struggling to meet the growing demand from electric vehicles and other high-tech products, increasing the risk of resource depletion. ESDM has pointed out that high-grade nickel ore with a content of over 1.7% can only sustain consumption for 7 to 10 more years. The Earth needs an efficient nickel recycling technology to extend the lifespan of nickel resources and meet the ongoing demand for nickel in the future.

However, existing nickel recycling methods are inefficient, costly, and harmful to the environment. Given the surge in nickel demand, the market shows a strong willingness to invest in a new nickel recycling system that meets the pursuit of innovation and efficiency. As a result, we have identified the potential customers for the MINERAL project as industrial manufacturers utilizing nickel, including battery manufacturers, stainless steel producers, industrial wastewater treatment companies, mining companies, and stainless steel manufacturers.

### Financial Analysis

【思考是否&如何呈现ing】

### Risks

In the current context where environmental pollution is difficult to measure as equitably as carbon emissions, our team's biological method lacks cost advantages when heavy metal ion concentrations in wastewater are high. Integrating this method into the end of chemical treatment processes also places high demands on facility infrastructure.

The shortage of synthetic biology talent means that after selling the product, we would need to provide customers with extensive and detailed after-sales services, creating significant pressure on human resources.

Moreover, existing nickel ion separation methods are relatively crude and inexpensive, leaving companies with little motivation to switch to biological recovery methods.
