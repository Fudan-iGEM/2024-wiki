# Team Fudan 2024 Wiki

We use [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [Vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) to build our wiki as an [Progressive Web app](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps) on [GitLab Pages](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/), not using [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/).

This repository contains **all coding assets** to generate your team's wiki (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, etc).

Images, photos, icons and fonts are stored on `static.igem.wiki` using [uploads.igem.org](https://uploads.igem.org), and Videos are embedded from [iGEM Video Universe](https://video.igem.org).

We built this wiki following guidance from [competition.igem.org/deliverables/team-wiki](https://competition.igem.org/deliverables/team-wiki).
