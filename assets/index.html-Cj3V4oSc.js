ASD is the most common and representative disorder within the category of pervasive developmental disorders. It typically begins in early childhood and is characterized by <strong>social interaction difficulties, communication challenges, restricted interests, and repetitive behaviors</strong>. Many children with ASD also experience various degrees of <strong>intellectual disability</strong>. They seem distant, which is why they are often given two beautiful names: <strong>Star Children</strong> and <strong>Angels</strong>.</p><p>Autistic children are often <strong>excluded from science education</strong>. The education they receive generally comes from their families, rehabilitation institutions, and special schools, focusing mainly on basic survival needs and the development of movement, language, and cognition. Few of them have opportunities to get mainstream education, let alone STEM education. However, <strong>does ASD inherently mean an insurmountable barrier to science?</strong></p><p>We want to say, <strong>the answer is no!</strong></p><p>In fact, studies have shown that individuals with ASD <strong>display <a href="https://www.autismconnect.com/blogs/why-children-on-the-autism-spectrum-gravitate-towards-stem-subjectssciencetechnologyengineering-and-mathematics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unique talents</a> in</strong> <strong>STEM</strong> (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields, including proficiency in systematization and analysis, logical and creative thinking, and compatibility with STEM. The protagonist of the American movie &quot;Rain Man&quot; and the real-life Chinese character Zhou Wei are both vivid examples. According to the statistics, people with ASD are more likely to <strong>pursue careers in STEM</strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#footnote1">[1]</a><a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-ref1"></a></sup>.</p><p>Unfortunately, <strong>real barriers still exist</strong>. Through literature reviews, interviews, <a href="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5115/inclusivity/asd-steam-survey.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">surveys</a>, and field observations, <strong>we have conducted in-depth research into the barriers</strong> that ASD individuals face in engaging with science. You can click <a href="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5115/inclusivity/research-on-the-barriers-bilingual.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> to view detailed research results and analysis. The following are the key findings.</p><ol><li><strong>Lack of specialized professionals</strong>: There are few educators focusing on the ASD population, and even fewer of them have the ability to conduct STEM education.</li><li><strong>The teaching content is</strong> <strong>monotonous, abstract, and detached from real-life situations</strong>: Instead of comprehensiveness and systematicity, most lessons focusing only on single course, such as mathematics. The content is often abstract and requires high cognitive ability from students.</li><li><strong>Low public awareness:</strong> Attention and inclusiveness of public towards the ASD population are insufficient, and the importance of scientific outreach for the ASD community is often overlooked.</li><li><strong>Economical Burden on ASD families:</strong> Families find it difficult to bear the financial burden of education.</li></ol><p>Our interviewees, including parents of ASD individuals, experts in special education and public welfare, as well as staff from rehabilitation centers and special schools, all expressed <strong>a shared desire to</strong> <strong>remove these barriers</strong>. This is exactly the vision we have gathered here for.</p><p>The following figure shows our overall strategy for addressing barriers.</p><div style="text-align:center;" id="fig2"><img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5115/inclusivity/barriers-new-new.png" style="width:100%;"><div><span style="color:gray;">The barriers that ASD individuals face and the solutions we propose.</span><br><br></div></div><br><h2 id="the-conception-of-steamed" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-conception-of-steamed"><span>The Conception of STEAMed</span></a></h2><div style="text-align:center;" id="fig3"><img src="https://gitlab.igem.org/2024/fudan/-/raw/main/img-should-be-compressed/steamed-pintu.png" style="width:100%;"><div><span style="color:gray;">The concept of STEAMed project.</span><br><br></div></div><p>For barriers 1 and 2, we decided to tailor comprehensive courses for the ASD population, relying on our expertise and interdisciplinary strengths. Based on their needs and characteristics, we propose an innovative educational conception called <strong>STEAMed</strong> (science, technology, engineering, art, mathematics, and medicine). The process of brainstorming can be roughly divided into the following three steps.</p><h3 id="_1-starry-wish-picture-book-library" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-starry-wish-picture-book-library"><span>1 Starry Wish Picture Book Library</span></a></h3><p>Inspired by our educational activities last year, we got the preliminary idea for the first lesson. Last year, we designed the &quot;Gene&quot; series of <a href="https://2023.igem.wiki/fudan/education/#feed-curious-minds" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">picture books</a> for children, which received sustained positive feedback. Therefore, we decided to base our first teaching session on the <a href="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/4765/wiki/education/picture-book-chinese.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&quot;What is a Gene?&quot;</a> picture book. We named the project &quot;<strong>Starry Wish Picture Book Library</strong>: to Engage Star Children in a Dialogue with Biology with Picture Books&quot;.</p><div style="text-align:center;" id="fig4"><img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5115/inclusivity/xingyuanhuibenguanhaibao.jpg" style="width:100%;"><div><span style="color:gray;">The poster of Starry Wish Picture Book Library.</span><br><br></div></div><br><h3 id="_2-from-stem-to-steam" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-from-stem-to-steam"><span>2 From STEM to STEAM</span></a></h3><p>In order to make the picture book more suitable for children with autism, we communicated with the children&#39;s book editors from Tongleiren and Fudan University Press. They agreed that the storytelling of picture books is beneficial for the ASD population to understand knowledge. They also enlightened us that <strong>art therapy is often used in special education</strong>. After the conversation, we conducted further literature research and found that <strong>STEAM</strong> (science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics) is an emerging interdisciplinary education model that allows students to approach science through appreciating and creating art. STEAM education greatly enhancing the <strong>comprehensibility and inclusiveness</strong> of traditional STEM courses. Both STEM education and art therapy have been proven to be beneficial for individuals with ASD. However, <strong>there is no research focusing on STEAM education for the ASD population</strong>. You can click <a href="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5115/inclusivity/review-from-stem-to-steam.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> to get our detailed literature research results. Therefore, we decided conduct the <strong>first</strong> STEAM education attempt for the ASD population. Specifically, we <strong>added painting and sticker segments</strong> to the picture book.</p><div style="text-align:center;" id="fig5"><img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5115/inclusivity/chubanshe.png" style="width:100%;"><div><span style="color:gray;">After the interview, we took a photo with the editors.</span><br><br></div></div><br><h3 id="_3-from-steam-to-steamed" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-from-steam-to-steamed"><span>3 From STEAM to STEAMed</span></a></h3><p>An art exhibition inspired us to further <strong>highlight medical elements</strong> in our curriculum. We served as volunteer guides and visited the <strong>&quot;Colorful Starry Sky&quot; Star Child Human and Art Theme Art Exhibition</strong> co-hosted by Fudan University&#39;s Human Science Museum and Angel&#39;s Voice Salon. The works were painted by Star Children after visiting the Human Science Museum. The <strong>bold use of color, innovative composition, and unique perspective</strong> in the paintings allowed us to intuitively feel the power of the integration of science and art, as well as the Star Children&#39;s <strong>talent in scientific perception and artistic creation</strong>. In addition, since human science is an important part of medicine, we realized from the exhibition that medicine, being closely linked to everyday life, plays a key role in helping individuals with ASD <strong>understand their condition, accept themselves and develop healthy daily habits.</strong> Therefore, building upon STEAM, we propose an even more innovative and targeted educational approach called <strong>STEAMed</strong>. Specifically, for the first class, we can inspire autistic people to think about the relationship between genes and traits, diseases, uniqueness, and value.</p><p>After the exhibition, we visited the director of the Human Science Museum and the person in charge of teaching at Angel&#39;s Voice Salon separately. We discussed our ideas for &quot;Starry Wish Picture Book Library&quot; and &quot;STEAMed&quot;. Encouragingly, they both expressed their support and willingness to cooperate. In addition, Angel&#39;s Voice Salon aims to enable angels to grow through the influence, which also inspired us to explore more artistic forms beyond painting.</p><div style="text-align:center;" id="fig6"><img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5115/inclusivity/2colorful-starry-sky-art-theme-exhibition.jpg" style="width:100%;"><div><span style="color:gray;">We visited the exhibition as volunteers.</span><br><br></div></div><p>Finally, our inclusivity program got its name &quot;STEAMed Education — for Children from the Star.&quot;</p><h2 id="courses-evaluation-system-of-steamed" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#courses-evaluation-system-of-steamed"><span>Courses Evaluation System of STEAMed</span></a></h2><p>We have decided to adopt STEAMed as our education conception and plan to adapt last year&#39;s picture book to teach genetics. <strong>One major challenge now is how to evaluate the course effectiveness during the process.</strong> A robust evaluation mechanism will enhance the effectiveness and scientific basis of our teaching. The core characteristics of the ASD population are social interaction and communication difficulties, meaning that feedback obtained from them may be limited. Therefore, we pay special attention to the perspectives of stakeholders. With the suggestions and guidance from teachers of nonprofit institutions, we designed the evaluation system. You can click <a href="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5115/inclusivity/interview-fang-fu-pre.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> to view the verbatim transcript of the interview.</p><p><strong>Our evaluation primarily focuses on the following six aspects:</strong></p><ol><li>How was the student&#39;s experience in this class?</li><li>How interested were the students in this lesson?</li><li>Did the students deepen their understanding of a particular issue?</li><li>Did this class improve the students&#39; literacy in six subjects?</li><li>Did this class help the students in their daily lives?</li><li>What aspects of this lesson can be improved?</li></ol><p><strong>Our evaluations include three types:</strong></p><ol><li>Objective evaluations through testing, distributed to students to complete after class.</li><li>Subjective evaluations distributed to students to score the course after class.</li><li>Subjective evaluations through interviews with volunteers, special education teachers, and parents involved throughout the process, to assess the changes in students.</li></ol><h2 id="the-preliminary-attempt-of-steamed" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-preliminary-attempt-of-steamed"><span>The Preliminary Attempt of STEAMed</span></a></h2><p>After the design of course evaluation system, we planned to carry out <strong>small-scale pilot</strong> teaching to achieve <strong>&quot;a breakthrough from zero to one.&quot;</strong> After the course, we would get feedback and further advance our project.</p><h3 id="pilot-objects" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#pilot-objects"><span>Pilot Objects</span></a></h3><p>Facing the challenge of large individual differences within the ASD group, we decided to adopt <strong>one-on-one</strong> and <strong>layered teaching</strong> methods. As the spectrum suggests, ASD includes various degrees of severity, with differences in intelligence, learning ability, and language expression ability. The needs of different subgroups also vary. For those with relatively low functioning, it is necessary to further simplify the course content and reduce the difficulty of the course, paying attention to strengthening and repetition in teaching. For those with higher functioning, the connection between course content and vocational skills can be more emphasized.</p><p>Subsequently, we began to select appropriate pilot objects. Compared with rehabilitation institutions, special schools have higher requirements for the formality and systematicness of courses and are not suitable as early pilot objects. After adequate communication with various rehabilitation institutions, we finally chose <strong>INDIGO</strong> and <strong>Light of Rainbow</strong>, both of which could arrange a fixed class time for us every weekend. INDIGO is the <strong>first in Shanghai</strong> non-profit organization to provide body, intelligence, and vocational development training projects for <strong>older</strong> individuals with mental disabilities. INDIGO Angels have relatively strong comprehension, social, and expressive abilities and have shown a greater interest in science. At the same time, INDIGO Angels are mostly in the vocational stage, such as baristas, chefs, <em>etc</em>. Light of Rainbow mainly provides physical and mental intelligence rehabilitation training for ASD <strong>children</strong>, representing another type of ASD group.</p><div style="text-align:center;" id="fig8"><img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5115/inclusivity/zhanyi-zhanlan.jpg" style="width:100%;"><div><span style="color:gray;">We were having online conversations with institutional teachers.</span><br><br></div></div><br><h3 id="curriculum-refinement-and-implementation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#curriculum-refinement-and-implementation"><span>Curriculum Refinement and Implementation</span></a></h3><p>We further revised the picture book based on the teachers&#39; suggestions, designed a preliminary course effectiveness evaluation system, and designed other supporting activities. For details on the teaching content, please see <a href="https://2024.igem.wiki/fudan/inclusivity/#the-practice-of-steamed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&quot;The Practice of STEAMed&quot;</a> below. Our differentiation in course difficulty is mainly reflected in the following aspects.</p><ul><li><strong>Teaching content:</strong> In Light of Rainbow, we will <strong>omit</strong> parts that are difficult to understand, such as the double helix structure of genes. We will also teach some concepts through more vivid <strong>analogies</strong>, even if these analogies may not be appropriate. For example, using shape and color matching to assist students in completing base pairing tasks.</li><li><strong>Number of teaching sessions:</strong> At INDIGO, we conducted only 1 teaching session. At Light of Rainbow, we conducted 2 repeated teachings for the same group of students, to enhance teaching effectiveness.</li><li><strong>Supporting activities:</strong> Light of Rainbow has more hands-on and activity segments.</li></ul><div style="text-align:center;" id="fig9"><img src="https://gitlab.igem.org/2024/fudan/-/raw/main/img-should-be-compressed/fencengshidian.jpg" style="width:100%;"><div><span style="color:gray;">We were conducting a Starry Wish Picture Book Library activity in Light of Rainbow (left) and INDIGO (right).</span><br><br></div></div><br><h3 id="course-effectiveness" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#course-effectiveness"><span>Course Effectiveness</span></a></h3><p>After the course practice, to understand the evaluation and suggestions for the course, we conducted interviews with teaching volunteers and parents of students. We have compiled and uploaded the <a href="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5115/inclusivity/interview-record-parents.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bilingual transcript</a> of the INDIGO interview, as well as the <a href="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5115/inclusivity/interview-record-targeting-rainbow-rain-with-tencent-meeting-link.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bilingual transcript and video link</a> of the Light of Rainbow interview. Overall, the interviewees <strong>recognized our use of picture book</strong>.</p><p>In terms of <strong>the understanding of knowledge</strong>, the performance of the students from <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/YPPsUTPAZ19k9FFzKl2bDQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">INDIGO</a> performed better than those from <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/YeO3UpyzIzm3GYnCJO6RvQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Light of Rainbow</a>. Students from INDIGO for the most part could understand the theoretical explanations. Even if some students had a lower level of understanding, parents believed that we <strong>&quot;planted a seed in their hearts&quot;</strong>. Students from Light of Rainbow, however, appeared quite confused during both sessions, with volunteers noting &quot;repeated many times and he still didn&#39;t understand&quot;, &quot;many tasks were done by parents on behalf of the students&quot;. Relatively speaking, the level of understanding after the second class was better than the first. Overall, these results <strong>demonstrate the feasibility of STEAMed layered teaching method</strong>.</p><p>We have summarized the suggestions of the respondents on how to improve the teaching effectiveness for Light of Rainbow students as follows.</p><ol><li>Reduce the content and time of theoretical explanations.</li><li>Repeat the same teaching content more times.</li><li>Add more hands-on activities.</li><li>Integrating knowledge into more forms of physical and artistic expression.</li><li>In course evaluation, more emphasis is placed on the accompanying significance of the course rather than the level of knowledge acquisition.</li></ol><div style="text-align:center;" id="fig10"><img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5115/inclusivity/zhanlanfangtan.jpg" style="width:100%;"><div><span style="color:gray;">We were conducting one-on-one post class interviews with teaching volunteers.</span><br><br></div></div><br><h3 id="the-next-step" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-next-step"><span>The Next Step</span></a></h3><p>We believe that the top priority is to <strong>establish a replicable education model</strong>.

With the support of these partners, we are confident in the long-term sustainability of our project.</p><p>In addition to the Bertalanffy Club, operated by iGEM, we have also reached long-term cooperation agreements with the Fudan University Nanshangu Association and the Fudan University Red Cross. Together, we will design and deliver courses.</p><p>We were invited to participate in the <strong><a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/rz5_monngU4MajMzbODBXg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Expedition Forum</a></strong> and the <strong>Fudan Public Welfare Exchange Gathering</strong>. At the Expedition Forum, there were four guests from large public welfare institutions and foundations, as well as public welfare organizations from 18 universities across six provinces. The Fudan Public Welfare Exchange Gathering included six guest professors, 18 alumni guests, and seven student organization leaders. During the open discussion, members of public welfare organizations expressed their willingness to collaborate with us, and the guests indicated that they would help connect us with more public welfare resources in the future to jointly promote this meaningful project.</p><div style="text-align:center;" id="fig31"><img src="https://gitlab.igem.org/2024/fudan/-/raw/main/img-should-be-compressed/yuanzhenghegongyiren.jpg" style="width:100%;"><div><span style="color:gray;">We were invited to participate in the Expedition Forum and Fudan Charity Exchange Gathering.</span><br><br></div></div><br><h3 id="funding-sources" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#funding-sources"><span>Funding Sources</span></a></h3><p>After submitting applications and going through a selection process, we successfully received funding from Fudan University&#39;s Undergraduate Academic Practice Research Support Program, known as the Xiangbo Project. We also secured funding intentions from the <strong>U.S. Consulate General in Shanghai</strong>. Additionally, Professor Fu Fang and Professor Yu Zhiyuan have expressed their willingness to help us obtain sponsorships from foundations and hospitals.</p><p>In the future, we plan to further diversify our funding sources.</p><p>In the initial stage, this includes securing grants from schools and government, as well as collaborating with non-profit organizations to cut costs.</p><p>In the mature stage, we will primarily seek funding from socially-conscious individuals and conduct fund-raising sales about STEAMed, striving to achieve financial independence and balance for the initiative.</p><h3 id="a-foundation-for-others" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#a-foundation-for-others"><span>A Foundation for Others</span></a></h3><p>Our STEAMed is an innovative and replicable concept. All of our course materials (including lesson plans, PPTs, post-lesson assessments, <em>etc</em>.) have been distributed freely both offline and online nationwide. We have summarized our experience with science education for the ASD population into two guides, which have been uploaded in multiple languages. We welcome other organizations to contact us through various channels to exchange ideas on how to optimize and promote STEAMed education. By doing this, other teams or external entities can easily build upon our work.</p><h2 id="conclusion" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#conclusion"><span>Conclusion</span></a></h2><p>In summary, we make efforts from four dimensions to eliminate barriers. Faced with scarce educational resources, we have developed an innovative educational concept, <strong>STEAMed</strong>, based on the needs and characteristics of individuals with ASD, leveraging our team&#39;s expertise and interdisciplinary advantages. We confirmed its effectiveness in practice. Using the iHP framework, we have thoughtfully practiced our ideas, creating replicable educational models and content. We applied commercial concepts to ensure the project&#39;s sustainability and promotion. Our project is not only about sparking interest, building knowledge, and offering career training for the ASD community but also aligns with SDG 4 &quot;Quality Education&quot; and represents an important step towards building a technologically advanced nation. We look forward to using diverse evaluation systems and teaching methods to move closer to science together through <strong>mutual learning and teaching</strong>. By enhancing inclusivity in the scientific community, we aim to amplify more voices in the field.</p><p>We believe that <strong>under the starry sky, we can all become scientists!</strong></p><hr><hr class="footnotes-sep"><section class="footnotes"><ol class="footnotes-list"><li id="footnote1" class="footnote-item"><p>Wei, X., Yu, J.
